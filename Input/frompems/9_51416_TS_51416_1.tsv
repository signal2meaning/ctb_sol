I could see the happiness on my father's face as the fish grew closer and closer to the surface of the water. Each inch was filled with a greater weight on my arms like someone was adding ten pounnds every time I reeled up, I didn't know how much longer I could hold on. The fish was thrashing all about now on the surface throwing droplets of crystal blue liquid all over. With one great reel down and an enormous heave up the fish came flopping into the boat, bouncing from here to there. The sun reflected off the fish and its beautiful scales into a magnificent rainbow. We both grabbed for the enriching amphibian, with its slimy slick scales it shot from my hand like a wet bar of soap. I felt the disbelief coursing through me, as my trophy now was deep in the lake. I looked to my father. We stared for a moment and symotaniously let out a deep laugh. I then cast my line back into the water just as the sun turned the water pink, and began waiting.	0		20130816140859	1290	0		20130816140827	1271	0
