She said it was 12:11 when even if she was correct that isnt the way your suppost to write they fraction out. First you need to add 12+11= what well if you know that 12+11=23 you will know that you will need to put two seprate fractions one for boys and one for girls what will look like this 12/23 are boys and 11/23 are girls so what you would want to do even if he wants it in the tim eit will be 12:23 are boys and 11:23 are girls. that is how i bleive that he is wrong he wrote the answer wrong and he put it in the wrong way but what you would need to  do is put it in siplest form so you would need to simplfi it if it isnt right but you cant simplfi it so in that case the correct answer would be 23 in total and 11 with girls and 12 with boys so it would be 23/24 if she isnt ocuting herself but if she is the correct answer would be 12 boy's and 11 girls but when you add 11+12=23 that is how i got my answer.
