Yomosef's friends heard his last words coming out of the donut bag. ""NOOOOOOO!!!!"" he said as he was pulled out of the shop. The boy's brother brought him back to the house. Something was strange about this boy. This boy tortured him over and over, bite after bite. He was asking the same question:""CAN YOU TALK?! CAN YOU TALK?!"" Yomosef was scared. He had heard about ancient ancestor donuts being able to sprout wings and fly way. He tried and tried, but he was too weak-his cream was everywhere! He accidentally fell off the table and flew away!
