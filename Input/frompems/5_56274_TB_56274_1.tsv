An archeologist is a scientist who studies items from the past. Being an archeologist takes hardwork. For example:</p> <p><b>Did you know when archeologist dug for George Washington's past, it took 2 weeks to dig a 25 square-foot section!!!(Look back in Source #2)</b>.</p> <p>Archeologists are usually strong and smart. If you become an archeologist, you will find cool things.</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologists also use tools. Some tools archeologists use are a trowel, a shovel, a whisk, a wheelbarrow, and a knife. The most common tool an archeologist will use is a trowel. This tool cuts to see diffrent layers of soil. If you plan on using tools, BE CAREFUL!!!</p> <p>&nbsp; An archeologist doesn't only deal with the history of people but, you could also find <b>LOST TREASURE!!! </b>Being an archeologist will get tiring but eventually it will pay off. Artifacts could be founded anywhere. For example:</p> <p><b>The archeologists who studied Fort James founded uncovered armor and weapons.(Look in Source #1)</b>.

Archeologist have a very unique job as well, they dig up artifacts left from historical times. They also help discover artifacts that have never been found before, as well as things we know of but have no clue where to look for them at.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist has many different tools that are available to them when excavating, they have a pick and shovel most digs often start with these two items. They are used to dig into the earth, fairly close to artifacts. They also have a whisk and Dustpan these are used to brush dirt from artifacts and clear it away from the dig site. They can also use a knife the knife is used for scraping dirt away from the ground and artifacts. Wheelbarrows are also available to archeologist, a wheelbarrow moves items from one place to another place that are to fragile to carry or it can be used to carry dirt away from the excavation site.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist also have lots of ways to use technology to help them as well. Computers can find were objects are in the ground by digitally scanning the area, computers can also tell how deep some artifacts might be berried in the ground. Computers can also tell where objects are and where to dig to find them at. Also computers can also tell an archeologist were to start digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist also have to be very careful when working on a dig site mainly because they could skip artifacts and or break artifacts. Archeologist have to use there special tools very carefully to insure they find as much artifacts and objects they can. Archeologist also have to be very careful with what tool they use for excavating. They have to use a different tool for each different type of soil.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist have a tough job that can be exciting, scary and fun at the same time. Many Archeologist have helped discover things of the past and things no one had ever knew existed. That's why today we can thank archeologist all over for helping us to discover some of the worlds most famous artifacts and pieces of history. We can also thank archeologist for the help they give and all the artifacts and treasures they have found for all the museums all over the world. Archeologist are a great help to the world and without them we would not have all the knowledge we have today, we would not have hardly any of the artifacts in museums or in galleries, nor would we have the knowledge on objects like dinosaurs and fossils without the help of archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021124816	560	1		20131021130459	223	2		20131021224141	509	2

There are very few jobs in the world that are more important than an archeologist's job. One reason an archeologist's job is so important because we would barely know anything about our past if there were no archeologists. We might be able to find little pieces of evidence, but we would still only know little bits of evidence about our past. One of the many things that we might not know about in our history if we didn't have archeologist's are what happened to George Washington as a child, because George Washington didn't write down what happened in his childhood (at least that we haven't found yet) archeologist's first had to know where George Washington grew up as a kid to find evidence of his childhood. Then they had to do lots of digging to find evidence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist's job is very hard. One reason an archeologist's job is very hard is that when they are digging for artifacts, they can only dig tiny bits of soil at a time because the artifacts would probably be very fragile because it is from a while ago and if they dig too much soil at one time, they might accidentally break the artifact with the shovel and then we might not know a part of our past because the evidence for it happening would be broken. Another reason archeologists job is hard is because they have to use shovels that can only dig up a small part of the soil, it can sometimes take day's to dig up 25 square inches of sand! That is a very long time for that amount of soil. If I had to do that job, I would start getting very bored and frustrated because it would take forever to dig up a tiny part of soil that might not even have any artifacts in it. One other reason an archeologist's job is very hard is for the archeologist's that work in the lab. They can study one artifact for days. That is a long time to focus on one object. Again if I had that job I would start getting very frustrated.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist has to have a tremendous amount of patience if they want to do their job well. Archeologists have a shovel that can dig a lot of sand in one dig. If the archeologist did not have very much patience, then they could take that shovel out and start digging with that shovel and if they did do that, then they would probably break a lot of the evidence and the evidence can't just appear in that spot again so the evidence would be broken and we might never know about a really important part of history. Also, the archeologist's that work in the lab have to have a lot of patience because if they didn't have a lot of patience, then they could just say that they studied every little detail of the artifact even if they didn't and again we might not know about a very important part of our history. If the people who carry the artifacts that are too heavy to carry by hand don't have patience, when they start taking the heavy artifacts away, they might want to speed up the process by running to wherever they have to take it. If they run with the wheelbarrow full of artifacts, two things might happen. One thing that might happen is that the artifacts could fall out of the wheelbarrow and break. Another thing that could happen is that the archeologist could drop the wheelbarrow with the artifacts inside of it. If either of the things happen the artifacts will probably break because the artifacts are from a long time ago and are very fragile. Those are a few reasons why an archeologist has to have a lot of patience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131018154410	547	2		20131021090153	554	2

In the past things were a little different and wasn't exactly like you would think it is. Most people think the past is just something that already happened and we don't need to worry about it but really it's how our world came to be today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Finding Fort James it talked about how the Fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life, and most thought that James Fort was built near the river. So they were all thinking &quot; Oh we will get there and we will get to see that fort, and experience what it's like to have hat fort.&quot; But really when they got there the fort wasn't there. So they thought &quot; Well it must of been washed away by the river.&quot; But seriously could a river wash away a fort? I would think not just because usually a river doesn't have waves and waves would be what could have knocked it down and washed it away. But there were hints in the area that the Fort was still around so was it really around somewhere else? It made sense that it wasn't there because they probably moved the fort to a new place to protect from enemy ships. So this was important in history, did they move it? What happened to it? They couldn't just forget about this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first objects were found in 1861, 254 years after the fort was built, they found uncovered armor and weapons, and they also discovered floors of buildings. So if they lost weapons and armor what could have happened? Did they get attacked? Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built again. What they were trying to do is relive the moment do it over again see why the fort was in that exact spot. And they were trying to see what happened to the fort, they wanted to see what caused it to fall down or leave.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Digging up George Washington's Past like in Finding Fort James they were looking for a shelter, they were looking for where George Washington lived. No one knwe exactly where George Washington and his family lived since the actual building was long gone. Archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there, so they decided to start digging in 2003, it took over a year but after that long year of digging they finally found it. They looked at it for a long and hard time trying to figure out what kind of rooms were still there. What they found was kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. And they didn't think that that was all that was still there and so later they found the main farmhouse a couple years later. So this was all very good information in history because they found out where George Washington lived and what some of the rooms in his house were.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All of these facts that archeologists found that they needed to know for some history. As you can see shelter was also very important in history so that was something very good that acheologists found. So all these facts were how the world became today and these are things that were very long gone but we worked long and hard to find them to make our world better today.</p>	2		20131021095247	926	2		20131021114300	554	1		20131022212910	509	2

The first one is about archeologists finding artifacts about Jamestown. In 1994, so many people were interested about the past of Jamestown because of a fort built in 1607. The time of when the fort was built in 1607 there were settlers from England who came to Jamestown to start a new life. Most people believe that the James Fort was built near the river. They say the new spot probably gave the settlers more protecion from enemy ships. The National Park Service has led a five-year study to figure out how the land was used back then. Then they have finally found the famous James Fort. Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. I think this takes such hard work to find many important artifacts each day, week, month and year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here is the second most important past also many people might and might not know George Washington. Many things we heard from George Washington is that he was a president, a soldier and a leader of an army. There is one thing we really don't know and it's much about George Washington and it's his childhood. There have been recent discoveries from historians when Washington was a boy. George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family to live in the Ferry Farm when George was just six. The archeologists were digging down deep for evidence. Then they have found evidence that George Washington and his parents did live in the Ferry Farm. It appears there was a fire inside the household because the diggers found pieces of burnt pottery and they have also found a clay pipe that Washington used to smoke so they knew it was the right house. Digging in Washington's past was hard for the archeologists because there was hardly any evidence but learing about the past is very interesting and that is all i can share.</p>	T		20131021153418	927	1		20131021200128	554		T	20131022154635	516		T

They would get dirty and wet. On the other hand the archeoglist who use computers dont get so dirty. But they get dirty in a different way.

Archeologist, is the name for a scientist who study objects from the past. Today, the group finds nearly one million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for children. The Archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens of&nbsp; burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first objects were found in 1861.

So James Fort and a group of people wanted to do an archaeological project, Now for that project they wanted to find a hut built in 1607. Next the first artifacts were found in 1861. These archeologist find weapons, uncovered armor,and washed away huts. We find them very important cause the piece of artifact is like 100-200 years old.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; When these people find the artifacts they wipe them off with a whisk. There are a bunch of tools they use as an archeologist they use a wheelbarrow, shovel, knifes and a bunch of other stuff. A wheel barrow was used to take dirt away from the site, and transfer dirt to the site. Now the shovel is used to dig out dirt to put in the wheelbarrow to take it away. so the last wepon&nbsp; but not the least the knife is use to cute hard ground and to gross stuff of of the artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well people always ask how do u find the spot to find the stuff, well people have live on the Ferry farm for 1200 years. So that gives you the idea to look there because 12000 years ago is along time ago. Example no body knew were Washington home was located but guess what archaeologist thought that the stone under it was still there so they started digging 2003 it took over a year but they finally found the stone, See what i mean there smart.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; So people always want to know why and how archeologist just know were these thing are well they don't just guess. So there are many electronics involved now but back then there was not ,but know this is what archeologist do they take a 3d computers that track the underground. thell find were it is then find all they'll need and then they will camp out at the site because they'll be hear for awhile. and the dig the whole day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021193055	550	1		20131022102352	223	1

The tools are a pick, shovel, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and a trowel. They use a pick and a shovel because most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. They use a knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. They use a wheelbarrow to move an item from one place to another. They use a skim shovel to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt away from the excavation site. They use a trowel to scrape and cut view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is all you need to know about archeologists.</p>	1		20131022132530	925		N	20131022143227	546	1		20131023130519	533	1

Imagine, thinking that this old structure was washed away many years before but now discovering that that was just a myth! Now you will work even harder to find out the real truth, is Fort James still standing today? Archeologists use many tools to help them with their jobs such as a pick-ax and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. These are all very important tools that help get the job done. Once you've stepped into the concentration zone of finding that fort, there's no turning back. Your heart is pounding as your getting closer and closer to the great Fort James. All of a sudden you step on something sharp. It stings so bad, you don't dare look down to see what you've arrived at. One of the other archeologists quickly helps to pull the unknown debree out of your foot. Finally they get it out, it was an old piece of a painting, dating all the way back to 1856!!! This means your getting very closer to your destenation. Archeologists were very concentrated on their work so they could get the job done. Or else they wouldn't get to go on any more adventures!</p>	2		20131021081534	554	2		20131021091629	925	2

In 1994 a group of people liked to study about Jamestown Rediscovery. In fact these men and women actually found the remains of&nbsp; the womderful Fort James. Fort James was built in 1607. The settlers thought the fort was built by the river, so they thought it would be easier to settle there so they could get picked up and dropped off at the docks. Anyway, the first objects were found in 1861. Over 100 years later, a group found even more ancient artifacts. Archeologists, a couple years than that, a group found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, I am going to tell you about the time people have discovered George Washington's Past. Archeologists believe that they found his past in 2003. Their equipment helped them a lot in this case. They mostly used the whisk and the wheelbarrow. The archeologists have even found George Washinton's old burned pottery.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Last, I am going to tell you about archeologists equipment. First, is the pick and shovel. Most discoveries start with the pick and shovel because it is used to chop through walls. Second, is the whisk and duspan. the whisk and dustpan are for the cleaning portion of the job. The knife is used for the careful digging. The wheelbarrow is used for moving the objects from one place to another. Skim shovel is used for the careful scooping of the object. Last, is the trowel. The trowel is used to scrape and view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That is all there is to know about archeology and archeologists.

Kids can sigm up for classes ,games, and crafts.There is an even interactive website!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021154619	223	1		20131022095625	926	1

This is called <b>archeology.</b> They have found reminants of Jamestown and George Washington's past.</p> <p>In 1994, a group of <b>archeologists</b> got interested in finding Jamestown. The fort was built in 1607 when English settlers came to start new lives. They thought the fort was built near the river because it was easier to dock ships there. But they were wrong. It was farther away. It took ayear to find it but they did. They found where they put their garbage back then. They found what toys kids used back then.</p> <p>They also found George Washington's childhood stuff. It took, again, a year to find it but they did. They found his kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses.</p> <p>In concusion, archeologists have discovered two places from the past it took them over a year each to find them but they eventually got info. on the two places.</p>	1		20131018144944	516	1		20131021095823	560	2		20131025084743	509	1

I know some good information on archeologists and now, you'll know too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is the jamestown rediscovery. Fort james was built in 1607 and some people believe it was washed away by a river and some believe it is still there. when the found James fort, the first thing was a set of strange marks on the ground. The marks showed where the forts walls used to be.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is George Washington's artifacts. Most of the things we know about Washington is his soldier and his presidencial times. Now that is changing because of the artifacts of his childhood. He lived on Ferry farm when he was six years old. People have lived on Ferry farm for over 12,000 years.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, im going to tell you about the tools of a archeologist. Most digs start with this one, the pick and shovel, which are used to dig into earth. Next is the whisk and dustpan, which is used for dusting of sand and clearing it away from the site. Then comes the knife and wheelbarrow. they are used for carful digging and bringing dirt from one site to another. Last is the skim shovel and trowel, used for digging into hard earth and sand.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know about an archeologist and all of the stuff they do.

Well if you like history,digging, and getting dirty than you might want to consider being an archeologist.have you ever been to a history mueseum and wondered how did those things get there, or read a history or science book and wondered how did they get that information or those pictures, well I might just have the answer for you it's one word Archeologists. Archeologists are kind of like scientists some work in lab others work on a historical sight like Fort James or George Washington's childhood house but they both are working to find out more abou our history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Shovels,pick axes,whisks and dustpans,knifes,wheelbarrows,trowels,and skim shovels these are tools that archeologists use while finding out about our history. first the archeologists will use shoveles,pick axes,skim shovels,and trowels to dig inti the dirt until they find an artifact, then tthey will tke dirt awy from sight in awheelbarrows, next they will knifes,whisks,and dustpans to clen the artifacts off as good as they can, last they wil take the artifacts will be taken away in a wheelbarrow to be studied and maybe someday be put in a mueseum.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are many kinds of different Archeologists lets learn about afew of them. When archeologists are at work there are many archeologists there the archeologists are split up into teams (there can be up to 35 people on a team).The first team maps the digging sight using 3D computers the computers can track what is underground, the information is recorded so that people will know what the area looked like befre they started digging. The second team will be doing the actual digging the place the people do the digging is called a dig. The third team spends days in the lab studying the objects that were found.This whole process of digging and studying is slow and tiresome, but if people didn't do this job we wouldn' know alot of stuff about our history such as dinosoars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Some archeologists teams have camps for kids so they can learn more about thier history such as the teams digging at Gerorge Washington's childhood house have a kid;s camp where they do classroom activities and outdoor activities to at this camp kids explore the digging site, expierence colonial life, and alsop become junior archeologists.kids can sighn up for crafts,classes,and games. Ther is also an interactive website where children can solve puzzles of the work being done on Ferrie Farm.So if this job sounds fun to you then you might want to consider being an archeologist.</p>	1		20131021095614	927	1		20131021191743	551	0		20131022095450	560	1

They find historical objects all over Earth. They can gather in groups of 35 people. Archeoligists can find hidden objects explorers can't even find! Archeoligists are famous for finding dinosaur bones and many other historical things.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The tools they use range from pickaxes to trowels. They,if it is absolutely necessary to mine,can use a pick to mine with. If archeologists have to scrape and cut the surface,they use a trowel to do that. They also use shovels,wheelbarrows,knifes,whisks,dustpans,and skim shovels. And,if necessary,they use their hands to dig also.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists can come upon many dangers in their expeditions. There co.uld be cliffs,holes,caves,sink holes. If they are in a snowy mountain,there could be a tragic avalanch. Another danger is freezing weather. And,of course,they can come upon dangerous creatures.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If there are expert archeologists in a group,the others are lucky. Experts know how to avoid creatures like snakes. They would also know how to avoid the other dangers. They could find areas the other archeologists couldn't. Also,more secrets could be revealed. There would also be a great leader for journeys into places like caves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to history,archeologists are the greatest. They can uncover hidden secrets. They can dig up fossils. Experts can find that stuff quickly. Archeologists have an amazing job.</p>	2		20131021155543	547	2		20131022095228	926	2		20131022215856	509	2

The article &quot;Finding Fort James,&quot; talks about how archeologists found artifacts at Jamestown island. The archeologists were working on discovering the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people had thought that James Fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries say that the fort might still be around.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The James Fort was built in 1607. Most people believed that James Fort was built near a river. The settlers that came from England went there because it was easier to dock their ships there and the fort was located further away so it probably gave the settlers more protection from their enemies and their ships. The archeologists uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. over a 100 years later, archeologists made a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Park Service led a 5 year study to figure out how the land was used. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. Finally, that's when they found James Fort. The archeologists found out where the walls used to be and that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and they found out that the fort went all the way til the river. The archeologists also found cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article &quot;Digging up George Washington's Past,&quot; is about archeologists working at George Washington's house. George Washington's home is also known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. Nobody exactly knew where George Washington's home was located since the real building was gone. Still archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in 2003, and it took over a year but they finally found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They also found the main farmhouse a few years later.</b><b> There were at least 4 houses that had been built on the Ferry Farm land so they need to find concrete proof that that was George Washington's farmhouse.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The archeologists found out that the Washington's had a fire in their house. The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery and they also found part of a clay pipe. The archeologists knew that George Washington smoked clay pipes, so this gives more proof that that was the right house. </b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the kind of jobs archeologists do. They find nearly 1 million objects each year. For example, pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Objects from the past helps us understand how people lived in the past. It is more than exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.

A wheelbarrow is used for moving one item to another or to carry away large amounts of dirt.Also a&nbsp; skim shovel used to shovel with a flat edge and used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.

First of all Indiana Jones is not your typical Archeologist. Second of all he was not real. Archeologist's are people who discover the lost and mysterious, treasures of history. Archeologist's have found some of the most historic places in history such, as the mythical city of troy. Howard Carter was a famous archeologist who found the tomb of king Tut. The discovery was amazing because most of the tombs in kings valley where robbed by grave robbers but, king Tut's tomb was completely untouched.Archeologist's find history and that is what they do for a living.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Archeologist's job dig up the past, basically. The common tools for an Archeologist is an pickaxe, a shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, a Trowel, and a whip &quot;Just Kidding&quot;. Sorry for the Indiana Jones reference, anyways those tools have specific uses. The pickaxe and shovel are used usually to start a dig. The whisk and dustpan is used for dusting of dirt and dust delicately. The wheelbarrow is used for carrying dirt away and some times it is used for carrying artifacts away. A skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of dirt. Trowel is the most common tool for archeologist's. It cuts away different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993 Archeologist's were looking for the seventeenth century Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. People had thought that the fort had disappeared because they thought it was washed away by the river that was next to it. The fort was built in 1607 for a new settlement in the America's. The first discoveries of the fort were found in 1861. They had uncovered weapons and armor. Then over a hundred years later Archeologist's finally found it. The used computer mapping and drawings to find where it was. The first thing they found was the marks in the ground. Those marks are they indication of where the walls were. The fort was in a triangle shape. They soon found the stone ledges that held the cannons for the fort. Archeologists found four cellars. They found ten buildings within the perimeter of the fort. They found dozens of burial sites around the fort too. Every year nearly one million objects are taken from the site each year. Those artifacts include coins, pottery,tools and children's toys. That excavation is an example of what the Archeologist's do every day for a living.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist's work hard to find history. They work hard to protect the history of the world. The things they uncover are amazing. Fort James is one of many excavations that archeologists do. Archeologist's find most of the things you can find in the museum. Archeologist's are my hero's. I want to be one when i grow up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022081558	516	2		20131022160116	533	1		20131023085533	509	2

Well, an archeoligist used a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim showel, and a trowel. they dig holes. The pick and shovel are to dig into the earth. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off and clear away dirt. The knife is to carefully dig and scrape. The wheelbarrow is to move items from on place to another. The skim shovel is to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last but not least, the trowel. The trowel is he most omportant tool for a archeology, it is to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil. Those are the tools for the archeologist. One time in the past, some archeoligist found lots of things that were in Washington's houe. In every team there can only be up to thirty five people. Did you know that it can take about two weeksto dig a 25- square-foot section? Can you believe that? Well, I can't either! The whole process is slow and tiresome, but its worth it. They had to find proof to see if it was really George Washington's farmhouse. Did you know that they started diggug since 2003, that's a pretty long time, don't you think? Do you know what the discovery of Washington's mean? It means that citizens of the United States a better understandingof who George wasbefore became famous. Also, now begining to know why he made decisions he did. I'm sorry, that is all I know from an archeologist. I just know that they dig holes 25 feet with some of their tools.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	0		20131022131627	551	0		20131022133553	223	0

They find all sorts of cool rocks, bones, and even fossils! There is a lot of tools like the trowel, the skim shovel, and they even use a wheelbarrow to work on and carry certain architectures.

We do it every single day. I Cameron Cancha am an archeologist that is in the team that studies the artifacts after they have been uncovered, so basically I get to see what the artifacts are.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One team maps the site on 3D computers that can track what is below the ground. Another team actually digs, the place they dig is called a dig. Those archeologists start with a shovel called skim shovels. Skim shovels are so small sharp and flat that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. The soil that has been removed then is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. The soil falls out and the artifacts stay in.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diggers also use a tool called a trowel that is a tool that is the most common, it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Troweling is the hardest process in archeology. You use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It takes a lot of time and effort!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then comes the last job, my job. My team and I spend DAYS in the lab studing the objects that were found. But finally we finish. My eyes get SO tired that I almost fall asleep, but I keep on working, my team needs me and I need them!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well those are the different jobs of the archeologists. If you want to be one then be my guest! But it truely is a tiresome process, it takes a lot of time and effort so just be ready!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Friend,</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cameron Cancha</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021151310	550	1		20131021192241	696	1

It involves brilliant people and careful manuvering. Each year, several teams of up to 35 poeple come to work on the project (AKA the dig). The first team is all computur geniuses. They map the area using 3D computpors that can track what's under ground. This information is recorded so that people will know where to dig and what it looked like before people started digging.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After that process is all done and through, they get the team in that does the actual digging, and thenanother team spends a day in a lab, studying the peices of things found. There is also more to this cool process, but I don't have enough time to finish this, cut I would definetely recomend archiology.</p>	1		20131021104021	563	2		20131021112917	547	1		20131025084743	509	1

The project was designed to discover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed by the river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.&nbsp; Most beleved that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to the dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would choose that spot. However , objects found nearby suggested the settlers more protection from enemy ships. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologist, the name for scientests who study objects from the past, a group effort to find the exactspot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.</p>	N		20131022110230	223		N	20131022135631	934		N

Two of the most common are the whisk and dustpan and a trowel. Tools are used for different purposes in archeology but all of them help in their own way.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First we have the whisk and dustpan. If an archeologist ever needs to clean an artifact he/she probably will use this tool. It's bristled end can brush dirt off artifacts, which can be important if there are any inscriptions on the artifact. The whisk and dustpan can also clear away any dirt from the excavation site, this is important if animals live near by. The whisk and dustpan is and always will be an important tool for any archeologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we have the trowel. it is probably the most common tool in archeology. Why, you might ask. the trowel is the most common because it's sharp end can cut and scrape through dirt to view different types of soil. The trowel is important because you can find many fossils in soil. Fossils are valuable after they are analyzed by an archeologist.Without the trowel, archeologists wouldn't find nearly as many fossils as they do with the trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools are by far the most important element of archeology, two of the most important tools being the trowel and the dustpan and whisk. With these tools archeology is a lot easier. Archeology would be nothing without tools so all archeologists are thankful to have them.</p>	2		20131021113004	546	2		20131021140504	554	2		20131021222812	509	2

It's accualy kind of fun.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get to spend a lot of time with the people you know. And you find new things every day.

One thing I learned is there always on the verge of discovery. How do they do this? Whats the process? Well that's what I am about to dig up for you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When archeologists first start they use a 3D computer to see whats under the ground. The information is the sent to the dig site that way they know what and were there looking for. But it can spend a couple days at the computers depending on how big the site is but that's only part of the process!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly the send the lay out to the dig site were it`s examined carefully. Then the digging begins! The diggers start the dig with skim shovels. they are used to remove thin layers of soil with every scoop. Then they can use the pick and shovel. the are mainly used to tear up the ground close to the artifacts.Thanks to the handy trowel they can usually find one million artifacts a year!&nbsp; but seriously we can`t forget the whisk and dustpan, it sounds like something you would use at home right? Well its also used to clear dirt off artifacts and get dirt off the excavation site. Last but not least is the wheelbarrow its used to carry things on and off the site.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now lets talk about why they would do this. Is it just for fun? well not really. You see its archeology that brought us the dinosaurs, its archeology that puts suits of armors in the museum! Like I said archeology is amazing! Oh big deal right. Well did you know that kids can get involved to?&nbsp; archeology is also educational. Who knew?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; you are all familiar with the name George Washington well did you know that archeologist found his house. You see archeologists aren`t two year old's playing in the sand box no, these people all have families but they choose to help dig up historical sites because they know how important it is. There like detectives of the past. and I`d just like to tell them thank you. I`d encourage you to do the same.Well now you know about archaeologists and what they do.

Their was a fire in the Washington's house so they needed proof that it was his house and indeed they did the diggers found a burnt piece of pottery.&nbsp; The diggers found clay pipes and Washington smoked clay pipes.&nbsp; JRA used a lot of different computer scanning system by using maps and a 3D scanner that can track whats under grown.&nbsp; &quot;The process is slow and tiresome, but worth it.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; From Source #3 Tools used by Archeologists.&nbsp; Source #3 was interesting it showed me what they might have used like a pick and shovel, whisk and dust pan or a knife.&nbsp; I know what your thinking a knife why a knife?

They were anxious for what was going on in the past. They went to go discover because they used to say he died because a river washed him away. They went to check if there was any discoveries. In 1607 setttlers came to stat a new life. They lived there and built a new habitat. That place gave them a spot with more protection from their enemies. Some stuff were discovered in 1861. They took them to the <b><b>archeologists.</b></b> They studied the objects. Some places did a five-year study. Then they knew that they had found James Fort.

I said being a football player is the hardest job. Jake and Bobby both said that being a archeologist is the hardest because you could spend two years looking for stuff and find only one thing. Plus you have to dig up a bunch of dirt in the hot sun.I told them that they were so wrong and that football's way harder, but that night everything changed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got home I did my regular routine. I ate a snack, did my homework, watched some TV, and went to football practice. It was eight o'clock when I got home, so I ate dinner and went to bed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up the next day, and got out of bed but something was different. I was already wearing clothes! They weren't just regular clothes they were digging clothes! I went outside and guess where I was? I was in 1994, digging to find Fort James! I didn't know how I had gotten there but some guy yelled at me to keep working. So grabbed a shovel and starting digging trying to figure out what just happened. I woke up In digging clothes went out my door and ended up at Fort James. Something was wrong!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was really hard to dig because it was so hot out and I was getting tired. Not to mention that the ground was really hard to dig up and it felt like I'd dig on forever.After awhile we finally got a water break. I was so happy I sprinted over to get some water. This was hard work you have to be strong and have a lot of endurance. The thing is that we haven't even found anything yet. This was hard work, long, and tiring work I know I wouldn't want this for a job!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I drank some more water I got back to work. I still didn't understand what was happening, but I decided not to ask. i&nbsp; was about to pass out from digging so long but when I stuck the shovel in the groung it made a thunk sound so I started to dig around it. With just a knife I started to dig aroundand guess what I found. It was a cannon every was watching and cheering but in between that someone was yelling at me to wake up. Every thing got fuzzy and I was back in my bed with my P.J's on. It wasall a dream! I told my mom when I grow up I want to be an archeologist. She asked me why and I said, &quot;It's because It's reall herd but in the your is making a discovery that no one's made before.&quot; I know now never to dought a job before you do it!</p>	1		20131021131941	547	1		20131021175409	695	2		20131021224141	509	1

Some people thought that it was built by a river. However some objects said that the fort was built further away. Also the new spot gave them more protection from enemy ships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They found there first object in 1861. Archeologists, the name for scientists who study the past uncovered armor and weapons. Also the discovered some floors of buildings! Then 100 years later people found out the exact spot of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then the National Park Service led a five year study to figure how the land was used.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now that is how they found out about Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131021152301	542		N	20131021161006	516	1		20131022220743	509		N

The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground that marks where the fort's walls used to be. Archaelogists studied the area by using a computer mapping software. The stories they heard and read, they knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. Archaeologists wanted to find artifacts of James fort. By the time they found the fort they found many artifacts. They found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings. They were all within the border of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today,the group finds nearly one million objects each year. The objects are pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for the children. The settlers that were there long ago, threw their trash in wells or into a big pit. While the archaeologists were digging to find more artifacts, they found the trash the settlers threw away also including the bones of the animals. The objects they found helps us learn how the settlers that were there lived in the James Fort. We now learned how the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they barely had any shelter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Settlers that were in James Fort lived in difficult years. Archaeologists studied about James Fort and learned how the settlers lived back then by finding the animals bones that they ate. Also, the ones that they threw in the unusual well or into the big pit. Back then, they didnt have any money or that much clothes.They had to hunt for food and when their clothes ripped the had to sew it back on. Settlers had a difficult life. Archaeologists learned how the settlers fought against the Powhatan tribe. The Powhatan tribe mostly attacked them when they were in there James Fort. Settlers in the James Fort lived a difficult life when the the Powhatan tribe attackted them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archaeologists studied many thinga about George Washington's farmhouse. George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved to Ferry Farm. So the archaeologists went to Ferry Farm, but know one knew exactly where the Washington home was located. They didn't know because the actual building was long gone. However, the archaeologists still believes the stone base that was under the Washington's home, was still there. They digged until 2003, they kept searching for the stone base, then finally, one year later, they found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. After a few years later, they have found the Washington's main farmhouse.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are more than one archaeologists trying to find the farmhouse. They were split into teams. There are almost thity-five people on just one team! The archaeologists&nbsp; trowels. Troweling&nbsp; is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt. There are three teams. One team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what's underground. The second team focuses on the digging part. The second starts their digging by using skim shovels. Skim shovels are so small, flat, and sharp they can remove thin layers of soil. The third team spends days in the lab. They spend days in the lab because they study objects that the second team has found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131022132058	547		N	20131022162206	927		N

They have discovered most of the historical articals or books you have read. Archeologists dont just have to dig up things and write about it. They have to figure out who it used to belong to, what the item is, and if it is important. But, they do much, much more. An archeologists job is tough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have to be thinking about what they are looking at very carefully for many different reasons. One reason is because they have to see if it can be useful. Another reasons is so they can figure out who it belonged to. This job is not easy. Archeologists have to run the object into many different tests. But they have help by many different kinds of help, by many different things. They get help by machines, people, and their brains. This means they have to understand their job completely, and they have tovery smart! Archeologists are tough and have to be brave at times.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists dont just use their hands, they use many other tools. Their tools are very special and have their own special use. Some of their tools are: the pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and the trowel. Archeologists use much many tools, but these are a few I can name. these tools come in handy at times. They all have their own use. The pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from arounnd the artifacts. Also, the wheelbarrow is used to carry items from one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excation site. Another tool is the skim shovel, it is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Now last, is the trowel. This tool is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. There is a lot of tools involved in a archeologist's job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists were trying to discover more about Geoge Washington. They have found bones the animals have chewed on. They have found broken pottery. They have even found George Washington's old clay pipes! This was an amazing discovery! The pottery they found looked burned, so they think they had started a fire in their house. But they are not positive. There is still a chance this could hve happened, but, it is not a fact yet. Archeologists still have a lot to discover and I don't think they will stop searching.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I think archeologists are super smart and are ready to face anything. Hopefully, they will figure out plenty of more things in history, but we just have to wait. There is no dought in my mind that they won't find out anything else.</p>	2		20131022115612	559	2		20131022204448	554	2

Here's how they discover it. Archeologists go to sites to look for where a well-known person used to live. Like, George Washington for example, recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped archeologists know more about him as a young boy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists recently went to the Ferry Farm to discover George Washington's past and recovering about this long gone farmland. The process of digging at the Ferry farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams will work on the site. The can be up to 35 people in one team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information will be recorded so that the archeologists will know what it looked like before people before started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers one at a time. Then that soil is placed in a box with a half-inched screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! And another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. the whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's really worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021135812	223	2		20131021192455	563		N	20131022154656	560	2

The archeologist have to dig and do other things to find artifacts the tools they use include, a pick and shovel used for digging into the earth to find underground artifacts, a whisk and dustpan used to brush dirt off of artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, a knife used for carefully digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts, a wheelbarrow used for moving artifacts from artifacts from one place to another, a skim shovel used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop, and a trowel used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The job of a archeologist is probley hard because they have to be very careful and not harm the artifacts they don't know where the artifacts really are so they have to use very little tools to dig so they don't damage the artifacts which is probley hard to do because they don't know exactly where the artifacts are.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When archeologist are digging they use things that will dust off dirt from artifacts like the whisk. The reason archeologist take their time digging up artifacts is to learn about people who over hundreds of years ago and their life and childhood life and tell the world about their history so we can know their past and learn about througout are lives.</p>	1		20131022130817	223	1		20131022164455	927	1

Be careful when using the pick it can hurt you and stop your searching. When you use the shovel you need to make sure it is ion the grouond low enough then scoop it out like ice cream. But when you use the pick you need to make sure it's only for breaking down sediments like rocks or heavy trees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then when you get to a point and scooped to much dirt and sand you use the wheelbarrow to carry it away so it is not in the way.

An archeologist is a person who finds rare artifacts about a certain topic. Lots of archeologists want to find artifacts that would impact on others people's life. Archeologists find facts about history and try to find the special details from that period of history. Archeologist don't always find the artifacts they want, they sometimes have to go by what the have.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People think an archeologist job is exciting. That is true, archeologist have a great job. They go back in time and find the history so they can present it into today's world. Most of the artifacts go in a museum. If they are very fragile and need to be handled with care they will probably leave them in a lab of take more care of it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discovering an artifact is something really exciting to do. When archeologist find an artifact they put them on <u>wheelbarrows</u>. A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry excess dirt and soil away from the site. After they collect all the artifacts they can find they take them to the labs so the workers of the labs can do their job. Archeologists have found artifacts from George Washington's house and from Fort James. Archeologist do have a cool job!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of different teams that archeologist have to work. There is the team that find the artifacts. They use 3D computers to find where the artifacts are in the ground. Then there are the actual diggers who dig the artifacts from the ground. Everyone has a certain job that really does matter!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools are really important while having this job. A few really important tools are</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; the skim shovel and the trowel. A skim shovel has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt and soil from the ground.

We need to look in the past so we can understand about life back then. Thing that we think are not important actually are important.

It takes long processing and time to find artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have several ways of finding old and intresing objects. Almost all their work is digging. Their tools help them so they would not get hurt and does not let them put marks on the artifact. Some people use wheelbarrows, or instuments that help people carry things, to remove dirt so that the other archeologists digging could dig deeper. Archeologists have to dig very deep because new layers of sand keep on forming.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although archeologists have very high hopes, they do not always find old objects. In a year, one group of people who study archeology can find nearly one million artifacts. Some of the objects they find are bones of animals, pottery, burnt piece of clay, and more. To make sure that archeologists do not get dirt, they use a whisk to wipe dirt off. Archeologists then study the object and make conclusions of what happend in old times.

Another team focuses on digging up the artifacts. They start digging with skim shovels and start removing thin layers of soil.

Once they find something they bring it to their lab and figure out what it is.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are teams that work together there can be up to 35 people on a team. Archeology is really hard work. They use 3D computers that track whats under ground. Then they get ther tools and start to dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do people dig? People dig so they can now more about that person that they are digging. They also dig so they no more about how people used to live. Being an Archaeologist can be fun to!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeaologists use a pick and shovel when they start. They use a Trowel it is one of the most commonly used tools, you use it to scrape and cut to view the diferent layers of soil. Other tools they use too, such as whisk and dustpan, knifes, wheelbarrow, and a shovel.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get involved Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes a very long time to find stuff. It took over a year to find George Washingtons house. It takes about 2 weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think It would br fun to be an Archeaologist for a job.</p>	2		20131021145002	927	2		20131021152621	926	2

Most believed that James Fot was built near the river.However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The first objects were found in 1861.Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.The National Park Service led 5 year study of the area to figure out how the land was used.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make image of the area.That's when they finally found James Fort! The first thing thet found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be.Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawing they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a tringle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today, the groups find nearly 1 million objects each year. In the 1600s, peopleused to throw their trash down unused well or into a bid pit. While digging in the area, the archaeologist found trash that settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.The information learned from these objects help us understand how the people in James Fort lived. We noe know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. It is exiting to discover objects that were regulary used by people who lived hundreds of years ago. It gives us a peice of our last and ties us to people who first started the American colonies.</p>	N		20131022131419	563		N	20131022140924	559		N

Historians do not know much about George Washington as an adult. They know more about him as a little boy. People have lived in a perfect place to build a home. George Washington was only six when he lived in a place like that it was called Ferry Farm. Four other houses were built on that land. Archeologist found all of those things in George Washington's house many years ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; George Washington's home has many reasons to be important. One of the reasons were because it helps historians about the type of Colonial Americans lived. The second reason was because it helps citizens know more about who George Washington was. The last reason was so we could know why he made his decision. most of these reasons are key parts&nbsp; of our past as Americans.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; During the summer the George Washington society runs workshops. Ferry Farm offers opportunities for kids to get involved. Kids can experience colonial life, explore the sight, and become junior archeologist. There is a interactive website.

For an example Fort James it took a long time for it to be found. But in 1861 archeologists uncovered armor, weapons, and floors from houses. Over 100 years latter archeologists found James Fort. Today archeologists finds nearly 1 million objects each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have a long order of doing things. They have to map the areas using 3D computers that track what's underground. The information is recorded so that people what it looks like underground before they start digging. Then they start digging, the place were they dig is called a dig. When they start digging they use skim shovels. The soil is placed in a box with a screen in the bottom, the dirt falls while the artifacts stay in. They use paint brushes, small shovels and wood picks.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The job of an archeologists is very important. If archeologists didn't do their job we wouldn't know much about our past. Like we wouldn't have known much about George Washington's child hood. Or where fort James was. Archeologists use lots of tools. For An example Archeologists use a pick and a shovel to dig close to the artifacts. A whisk and dustpan is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the site. A knife is used for digging and to scrape dirt around the artifacts. A wheel barrow used to move items from one place to another or carry dirt from the site. A skim Shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil.&nbsp; A trowel is a common tool in archaeology, It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022130333	925	1		20131022133232	223	1

I think the job of an Archeologist is to dig in the dirt to try to find interesting artifacts. I chose this topic because I thought that it would be interesting to write about something I don't usually think or talk about. Did you know that when Archeologists are troweling, it can take them up to 2 weeks to dig a 25-square foot section?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start off my essay, I am going to be talking about the job of an Archeologist. An archeologist is someone who digs in the dirt to try to find ancient and interesting artifacts. When they find these artifacts, they often sell them to museums for a profit. When the museums get that artifacts, they put them on display so that different people can see and examine them. The artifact often stays in the museum for a few years and them is shipped off and put in storage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next paragraph is about the different tools that archeologists use. Archeologists often use different tools for different jobs. Most digs often start with a pick and shovel. These tools are mostly used for digging into the earth up close to artifacts. Another tool that Archeologists use is a trowel. A trowel is probably the most common tool used for archeology. It is used to scrape and cut the different layers of dirt or soil. The last tool that were going to talk about are a whisk and a dustpan. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off many artifacts in order to get them cleaned off.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last informational paragraph is about how the text relates to the topic. I think the text relates to the topic because....</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br>The text and the topic are both on archeology. <br>The text shows how and why archeologists do what they do.  <p>The text clearly states that archeology is fun job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wrap up my essay, I chose Archeologists for my report because I thought that it would be a fun and interesting essay to write about. I think that all of my paragraph clearly state how archeologists do what they do. Hey, did you how that when Archeologists are digging on a site, there can be up to 30 people? That wold be crowded!</p>	2		20131021194018	555	2		20131022105726	542	2		20131022164958	533	2

Finding artifacts from years and years ago is not easy, but it can be made slightly easier with the right tools.</p> <p>&nbsp; Most of the archeologists dig at the site where they think an artifact is. They use several tools, including the skim shovel, the trowel, and the pick and shovel. The many diggers dig through a very large area, and it can take weeks. You don't always find something though.</p> <p>&nbsp; As mentioned before, you must be patient when digging. There were settlers in 1607 and the first artifacts found from them were discovered about two hundred years after. You also have to study, and a <b>lot</b>. The National Park Service studied for five entire years just to figure out how the land was used. Sometimes, it doesn't take as long, but it usually takes a while.</p> <p>&nbsp; Also, you may not know whether the artifact you have found is from that time. People may have later settled in that same area and left more modern things behind, and you have mistaken it for something ancient. Or, you might just be looking in the wrong spot and not find anything at all. You might mistake something useless for something valuable, or vice versa. Archeologists have to be very careful when they examine the things they have found because it might be worth something. You never really know until you study closely.</p> <p>&nbsp; When a group of archeologists is lucky, they can find nearly one million artifacts each year.</p>	2		20131021190411	559	2		20131022132738	555	2		20131022222807	509	2

Today I will tell you about George Washington,how people dug his up his house, and what he did for our country while he was president.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington was a fine man. He was very nice also. He did very good things for our country while he was alive. He had wooden teeth! He also had a bunch of kids. He lived a long time ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003 some archeologists went to dig George Washington`s house up. They went to where he lived and tryed to dig his house up. It took about one year for them to dig his house up. They found his house and found his kitchen and other parts of the house. They got proof too. It was really cool!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When George Washington was president he did very good things for our country. He helped us in war and a lot of other things that we neede help in. He was a very good man! Everybody liked him. Then one day he wasn`t president and everybody was sad. He was also our first president.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I told you a lot about George Washington. He was very friendly. He was a very distibutive man.

Well, an archeologist is where you study about objects from the past. Sometimes, when you you find artifacts about different things, it may take a long time to find, brush, and clean. Smaller artifacts can be very hard to find.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeology is one of the most interesting studies. If you find an artifact you can use a special tool or device to help find out where it came, from how old it is, and how big or small it is. The National Park Service led a 5-year study to the area to figure out how the land was used. During the 1600s, archeologists found trash that the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objects found over years include pottery, tools, coins, rocks, and also metel toys for kids.

They take the artifacts and see how they've been handled and that tells us the story. Cleopatra wouldn't of existed to us if we didn't find her tomb.</p> <p><br> &nbsp;I think the job of an archeologist would be fun because you get to find history and ancient artifacts or fossils.

These&nbsp;items are called artifacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Archeologists usally search&nbsp;underground for artifacts. They can look anywhere, houses, battlefields, and more. Sometimes archeologists are payed money to put the artifacts in museums.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are usally very smart when it comes to where to look and what technology to use when looking for artifacts. I'd think that the most used tool is the skim shovel. It is flat edged so it can remove an entire layer of soil with each scoop. The pick and shovel are 2 very important tools for an archeologist. They're used when the archeologist know they're close to an artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this was a convincing report and hopeful, you will become an archeologist.</p>	2		20131021130918	535	2		20131021134741	563	2

Once they find fossils, they go and clean those fossils and see what they were in the past. Archeologists spend alot of time cleaning and finding fossils.

Without them we would not know much about things like what tools people used or even where they lived. They teach us about how the people survived and also how they fought enemies. It also lets us know why people made the decisions they made and what they were like.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>How do archeologists find all that information? First, they must find the site that the place they want to find out about is on. They look for artifacts that were used at the place and when they find some they know that the place was near or where the artifacts are. Next, they use a 3D computer that track what is under ground so that the archeologists know what to look for. Then, they start digging. They are very&nbsp; careful not to damage any artifacts that are under the ground so they only dig up a bit a of dirt at a time. Finally, they study the artifacts they found and decide what they mean.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What tools do the archeologists use? Some examples of what they use include:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br>A pick and shovel for digging <br>A whisk and dustpan for brushing dirt off the artifacts <br>A knife for careful digging and to scrape dirt off artifacts <br>A wheelbarrow to transport dirt and items from one place to another <br>A skim shovel to remove thin layers of soil <br>A trowel to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a bit of an archeologists job.</p>	2		20131021132121	696	2		20131021140845	550	2

Archeologists have a very important job. They find old pieces of pottery or bone, which then go to the museums that we go to today.It might be cool to do such an important job like this, but it can be hard too. Image being out in the hot sun or the cold wet rain, weather is a big part in digging for old treasures. Such as if it's raining the miners cant mine and if its too hot they will be uncomfortable and they might rebel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; First of all, some artifacts help people learn more about our past and the artifacts can also help us find old burned down buildings or some that are so old that the walls are barley standing. An example of this is Fort James. Fort James has lots of artifacts around it that lead archeologists to believe that Fort James was farther away than it actually was and is. The archeologists used different tools to help find the artifacts. Such as a pick, shovel, knife, trowel, and a skim shovel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Thats most of the work that some people will do today.

That is sometimes true but archeologists really are people who find the remains of the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; One group of archeologists went to try to find Fort James from 1607 when the settlers came to acquire land. They found Armor and weapons in 1861 they also found floors to many buildings.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Another went to the area George Washington's house was built at and found many items like a clay pipe and burnt pottery. Which many people may find fascinating.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologists use many tools while working. One tool they use is the pickaxe and the spade or shovel. They use these tools to start the dig down to artifacts. Another tool they use is the skim shovel which I find very cool. It is a shovel that has a flat edge and is used to remove a thin layer of soil. There are many other tools archeologist use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Therefore, archeologist are people who look for lost artifacts of the past and use many tools like a skim shovel or pickaxe.</p>	1		20131021083419	925	2		20131021091712	535	2		20131025085143	509	1

Basically, they have to investigate the lives of those who lived long ago. But, they also have to have the correct items to identify what people ate, did, etc. After cleaning those items, they relate them to what they would have been used for. For an example, if an archeologist was examining the life of Native Americans in one of their ancient huts, and he/she found a rabbit skeleton, then he/she would know that Native Americans ate rabbits. They study the past, discover new things about it, and can teach others about what they've learned.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An archeologist studies the past in order to get information on what they are trying to discover more about. That way they already have an idea of what else they need to know. Then, they head out to explore more about the subject. It might not be as fun to just learn about something, but it pays off when archeologists get to uncover artifacts and discover things about them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An archeologist discovers new things while obtaining old artifacts. By finding one item, the archeologists are able to find out more things based on this &quot;newly discovered&quot; object's uses and relate them to what people did. As I said earlier, we could find out that Native Americans ate many rabbits, and if rabbits were extinct today, we'd know what caused that extinction. It is also very useful to learn about because we can discover the cause of things that have happened. For an example, if we didn't know why the sky is blue (even if we do), and let's say that we found out that there was some &quot;blue chemical&quot; released into the air because there were hints of it in crumbling caves from long ago, we could get rid of other fears that we have, like excess carbon dioxide makes it blue or some nonsense like that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lastly, archeologists can teach others about what they have learned. Obviously, they don't just find information and store it in their brains. They tell others, let's say some scientists who will then scientifically analyze that artifact and find out even more. Then those scientists will put what they learned out to the public, in a book, most of the time, to educate others. It is always good to know more about a subject because it benifits you with more knowlege. So, technically, archeologists teach the world about what they've learned.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have a challenging job that benifits the rest of us. They study the past, discover new things, and can teach others about what they've learned. They have an important job in our society. They dig for history!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022110230	223	2		20131022135631	934	2		20131023100939	533	2

That may have been an artifact from long ago! This is what some people do for a living. They are archeologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do they do it?Archeologists use special 3-D computers to track what is underground. next they record the information. Then they go to the site where they found the artifact and then they go dig. First, they use a small, sharp, and flat tool called a skim shovel and remove each layer one at a time. Next they put the dirt they had just shoveled out and put it in a sifter so that the dirt goes out and the artifacts stay in. Diggers also use troweling to find things as well. Troweling is where people use paint brushes wooden picks and small shovels to find the artifacts. It can take up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five-square-foot hole! Then they go to the lab and examine all the different things they found. Trying to find the artifacts is very difficult, tiring, and a lot of work, but it is worth it because we find out so much about our history through the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some tools they used include: the pick and shovel, whisk and dust pan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel and used to start digs and tom penetrate the earth to get to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan were used&nbsp; to brush the artifact clean and clear the dirt away from he digging site. The knife was used to scrape thick layers of dirt that are on the artifact off, and to carefully dig it out. The wheelbarrow is used to move the found items and dirt to different locations. The skim shovel is used to remove a thin layer of soil at a time with its sharp flat edges. Finally, the trowel is is used to cut soil so the archeologists can see the different layers. It is probably the most common tool an archeologist uses.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeology can give us a better understanding and more knowledge of someone and/or a time period. For instance when they found George Washington's home that he grew up in, we learned more about: him as a boy, what led him to make the decisions he had made, how people lived in colonial times, etc.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, archeologists have a hard, fascinating, long, and knowledge-gaining job. We can learn so much about history from archeologists work. I want to be an archeologist when I grow up so that I can dig up our past!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022131441	927	2		20131022140954	551	2		20131023094821	533	2

You'll need the patience, passion, and precision.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You might have to wait a while before you start digging. And even if you do dig you might not find what you are looking for. Most archeologist have to search for decades for the artifacts they want to find. Sadly, sometimes when they do find artifacts they are entirely fragile and break within seconds. It is important to wait for things to come before you start looking like clues of its existence. Often, seeking something without patience will quickly diminish.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You need some passion for discovery if you are going to become an archeologist! Don't just say,&quot; Oh I'm going to be rich and famous because when I am an archeologist I'll find a gigantic chocolate city!&quot; That's not how it works. You want to be an archeologist because you are doing it for fun. It is important to think about what doing a job is really like. In life, don't look in the past or future, focus on the present.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Precision with tools is what you also need to be an archeologist. The pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skin shovel, trowel, and many of tools are involved with the job. If there is a ancient pot need to be dusted for futher examination and you sweep it like a madman... CRACK! It is important to be careful with everything. Generally speaking, not everyone can do everthing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have patience, passion, and precision these thing you are the man for the job!</p>	2		20131021144051	925	2		20131021182726	542	1		20131022163015	533	2

First, you can get books about archeology and learn more, find information, and see how you can find items. After, you do that&nbsp; ask your parents to help find camps near by you. Finally, you can go to college with archeologists and more! Thank you for reading my tips.</p>	2		20131022110350	695	2		20131022142654	925	2

For over 200 years,&nbsp; people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock&nbsp; ships there, so it made&nbsp; sense that the settlers would&nbsp; choose that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away. The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would hep them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That's when they&nbsp; finally found James Fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read, and drawing they made,the archeologists knew that&nbsp; the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort stretched&nbsp; all the way to the river.Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons.The archeologists also found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today, the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The objects include pottery, tools,coins, and even metal toys for children.In the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. While digging in the area, the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away, including the bones of animals they ate.The information learned from these objects&nbsp; helps us understand how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. We also know how the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who first started the American colonies.</p>	N		20131022132628	925		N	20131022141249	696		N

They are very signifficant in many ways. For example, we need scientists to discover and teach us about how life and earth was in the past. So archeologists and people know how and why things happened.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have been discovering rearly one million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Archelogosists have discovered many things. For exaple, in the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down an unused well or into a big pit. The also know how the settlers survived when they had little food. Archiologists have been using technonlogy and hand tools to dig up the best and finest information they can find from the past. For example, the used tools like pick and shovels, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. These tools where really important.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Most digs start with the Pick and Shovel. It is used to dig the eatrth, colse to the artifacts. The Whisk and Dustpan is ued to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Knifes are used for carefuly diging and crapping dirt from around artifacts. The wheelbarrow was an important tool. It is used to move itmes from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The Skim Shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. And the last tool is the trowel. It is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is ues to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Archelogist are also using small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. Archiologists are using 3D computeres that can track waht is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know how it will look when they start digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;In conclution, Archeologists have a really important job. Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. Archeologists are bringing to life the county's first president in ways we have never seen.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021192411	546	2		20131022131238	554	1		20131022222807	509	1

They had found burial sites,cellars, and pottery. The border of the fort was the way all the to the river. There they found were cannons had bean laid for defenses&nbsp;&nbsp; against their foes. It was first suspected to be there when a&nbsp; archeologists in 1861. He had found armor and weapons during his dig. These items were found by a group a hundred years later. National park had a little study that went to five years. Now they they find a lot more items then they did on the first day. They are mostly money, pottery, odd and old tools, and metal toys.

The dig had started in 2003.His house used to be in/on Ferry Farm.They did not know were his house was until a group found artifacts like a pipe. However this is a small piece of evidence, but we do know that George liked to smoke pipes. It took them a whole year just to find one building.They found a farmhouse a couple years later. Also there were four other houses in the area they weer digging in. So, they needed to find more proof.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source #2</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging up Objects</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A processes of digging is a hard work for people who are not. Any ways there is a first group of the computer guys who do the 3-D of what the land would have looked like back then. Then the second team works on the real digging rather than the 3-D computers. They start out any dig with the skim shovel rather than a regular shovel. The reason why is because of how takes a layer of soil one at a time.</p> <p>Then the soil is put into a small box with a screen at the bottom this lets the chunks go into the screen and the soil slips into the small holes in the screen. Troweling is also a good way to dig. Troweling is what archeologist use with a small shovel, paint brushes, and wooden pick axes. They all remove the dirt, this procces can take up to two weeks just to dig a 25-square-foot hole!The last but not least science team actualy examines and determine what the object actualy is and was used for.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021084117	926	1		20131021092952	547	1

It may take months or years to find what they may be looking for, and they have specific tools. Archaeologists may find everyday objects from years ago, or one of our old presidents houses!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Archeologists use tools you may even use in your garden. Some of them are: wheelbarrow, trowel, and a shovel. Though some aren't everyday objects for example: Whisk, pick, or a skim shovel. A skim shovel is used to remove small amounts of dirt at a time. The soil removed is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This screen allows soil to fall out while found artifacts stay in. Another tool is a whisk and dustpan, these are used to clear soil off artifacts. one tool that is a good use outdoors in general is a wheelbarrow. wheel barrows can be used to move artifacts and/or other items. they may also be used to clear dirt away from the dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finding one item or place can take many years of work from many teams. When finding Fort James,</p> <p>Archeologists uncovered armor and weapons, they also found floors from buildings. Over 100 years after those discoveries, multiple teams&nbsp; put in effort to find where the fort was built. These teams took more than 100 years to just begin searching for where Fort James was built. finding objects from hundreds of years ago may take a hundred years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Some things or places Archeologists searched for were fameous landmarks, such as George Washingtons house as a young boy. No one knew exactly where THe WAshington home was located because the building was far past gone. Archeologists believed that the base of the house was still there. they began digging in 2003, It took over a year to find it. but they only found few rooms at first, the kitchen,, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found th farmhouse years later. The diggers needed to prove that this house did belong to the Washington family. Rocords had shown that there had been a fire. THey found pieces of burnt pottery, witch shows a sign that there had been a fire there. They also knew&nbsp; that Washington smoked clay pipes, when they found part of a clay pipe, that gave more evidence that this was george washingons house as a boy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Argheologists look for things over very long periods of time, with specific tools and artifacts could be part of a fameous landmark.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022115440	223	1		20131022132115	535		N	20131023133043	516	1

Their job is to study and discover objects from the past, those objects will teach us about what people in the past ate or what they hunted with, even what they created shelter with.

Sometimes they have even found skeletons or just bones of animals.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When archeologists are searching for fossils, bones, or an object they use a pick, shovel, skim shovel, trowel and knife to carefully get the artifact without fracturing it. Once the archeologists have gotten the artifact out from the ground they use a whisk and dustpan to carefully dust of the dirt from the artifact.

Well of course it is! Here's why this is my belief: Archeologists discover a lot of artifacts and they even discover long lost places. They dig for certain things with certain tools. That's super interesting! Archeologists find bones, marks in the ground, and they even find fossils. But most of all, they dig up history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, archeologists discovered dinosaur bones. But they also discovered Jamestown's Fort James. The story behind the fort was that it was washed away by a river flood. But soon, archeologists discovered that it still exists. Actually, none of it was still actually there but the memories and marks in the ground showed that was exactly where the fort was. Archeologists found artifacts near the marks in the ground where the fort was so then they new that the fort was there because of the evidence. That's how archeologists rediscovered Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, archeologist's jobs sound fun! Not only did archeologists discover artifacts and Fort James, but they discovered George Washington's childhood home. Now, Washington's home is still around...Still standing...Still active! Archeologists decided to keep the house open for visiting, so people can check out how it was like to live like a colonist. Also, they hold classes where children learn to become a junior archeologist and to solve puzzles about the colonial time period right inside and near Washington's home at the site where you can see the giant artifact, his home!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools are most important to archeologists! If an archeologist doesn't have tools, how is he or she supposed to discover artifacts. Think about it, if archeologists don't have tools, then museums wouldn't be around today. Picks and shovels are used for digging. When digging, these are normally the ones that archeologists use first. They use whisks and dustpans, too. The whisks are for dusting off dirt and the dustpans are to collect that dust. Knives are used for scraping off the dirt and cutting the dirt to dig. Wheelbarrows are used to carry an artifact from one place to another. Skim shovels are used for removing one layer of soil every scoop. Trowels are used most commonly because in archeology, they truly are the most helpful.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I hope everyone thinks that archeology is important to history. Archeologists truly do have an fun and important job. They sure do know how to dig up history!</p>	2		20131022140924	559	2		20131022144817	554	2		20131024082203	509	2

In this story you will not just learn what they do you will learn how they do it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archeologists have a very important job. They find our history so we can learn too. Read on and find more about Archeologists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody knows where the Washington's house was. Archeologists believed the base was still there. In 2003 archeologists started to dig. After they start digging they have to be prepared to prove stuff too. Like after they found what they thought was Washington's house they had to prove it because 4 other houses have been built on that lot. They proved it by finding burned clay in the house because the Washington's had a fire in the house. Archeologists also have teams. One team uses 3-D computers to find where the stuff is underground. Another team digs up what the other team finds with tools like Pick Axe, Whisk, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. And another team study's the findings.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have to guess sometimes too. Like when they were trying to find the James fort. They didn't know where the fort was. They thought it was by the river but others said it was farther away from the river. So they had to guess which one and they found the fort away from the river.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have to be very, very careful also. They have to use tools that wouldn't damage any of the findings of the objects like whisks, and trowels. That would be the last thing archeologists would want to have our history damaged. Sometimes it can take 2 weeks to dig up a 25-square foot section. It takes <u>so</u> long for this process to take place but it is definitely worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today 1 Milloin objects are discovered each year. Archeologists have cool jobs, maybe you would like to become one someday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022130054	555	2		20131022134922	695	2

Sometimes archeologists will study some historical sites from where some past presidents have lived. Just like where George Washington lived when he was a boy before he became president. Or maybe you could explore a fort like Fort James! Being an archeologists could be a fun job for a lot of people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have to use many tools. Some examples are: a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. A pick and shovel are used for digging into the Earth and getting close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan are used for brushing dirt of the artifact&nbsp; and clear away dirt from the site. A knife is used for for careful digging and to scrape dirt away from around the object. The other objects are used for different things too. Those are just some examples.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finding the things that archeologists find at the location has a long process behind it. Especially the project at George Washington's house. Their process is a very careful one. Each year they have A LOT of teams work on the site. There can be up to as many as 35 people on a team! Now that is a lot! The first team will map the area using a 3D computer, that can track what is underground. The information is recorded&nbsp; so that the people on the teams know what it looks like underground before they start digging.One of the other teams that are on the project will focus on the actual digging. The place where the actual digging is done is called a dig. Well that makes sense!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once they have finished digging up the soil, it is placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This will let all the dirt fall out while artifacts stay in. The diggers use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It could take up to 2 weeks to dig up a 25-square-foot section! Then one more team spends DAYS in the lab studying the artifacts that were found. The whole process is slow and not so fun, but it is totally worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you see, being an archeologist is hard work. Even though it seems hard, I bet you would still want to be one!

Archeologist are here to help you understand. In 1994 a group of people were trying to discover the secrets behind Fort James in Jamestown Virginia. Over 200 people say that it was washed away by a river. Discoveries say that it still may be around.It was built in 1607 near a river. They built it there so ships could dock there. There are objects that suggest that there was another fort located farther away.The new spot gave settlers more protection and safety. Archeologist first found the objects in 1861. The national park service led a 5 year study to the area to figure out how the land was used. They used mapping on the computer to make an image on the area. That's when they found fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist are people who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered floors and buildings over 100 hundred years old. Some of the tools that Archeologist use are a knife, pick and a shovel,whisk and dustpan, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know much about George Washington's childhood? Let me tell you a little bit about it. He as a boy moved to Ferry Farm when he was 6 years old. The Farm is 12,000 years old. Archeologist didn't know exactly where the house was, so the Archeologist had to do some research ion where it was. In 2013 they started digging. In a year they found where the house was. The first building they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main house a few years later.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know what Archeologist do when they have to find information when they need it. You also know what kind of tools they use. Let's review. They have the whisk and dustpan, pick and shovel, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, trowel, and last but not least the knife. Thank you for reading this article. This information you should now know now.</p>	2		20131021144016	926	2		20131021145257	927	2

Archeologists are sorted into teams, there can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologists start to dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Trowling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.</p>	N		20131021141203	547		N	20131021151023	554		N

They both talk about information. Also the archeologists. In 1994 a group of people are iterested in studing the past of James Town Rediscovery Archeologists. It was designed to descover the town of James Town, Verginia. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life for them. The archeoligists found evedents from James Town.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you can see archeologistsfound all of these things about Fort James Town. Those archeologists dig up things that we can not find right now they diged them with a shovel that was called the skim shovels.

Once they find the spot where the artifact is they will Start digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start a dig they get into teams of about 35. One team gets the 3-D image ready and the other team digs. Some digs are really long, like the Ferry Farm Dig. Ferry Farm is where George Washington lived. In the Ferry Farm Dig they found a clay pipe witch George Washington used to smoke.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major dig was the James Fort Dig. This dig was to find James Fort. Before they started the dig people thought that the fort got washed away. But as they started to dig they found that the fort stretched miles out from the river. They found signs of the forts walls which was one of the clues that told them that the fort stretched out so far.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some tools used for an archeological dig are:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br>Pick and shovel  <p>Most digs start with this tool.

A dig is when people dig to find artifacts. To start a dig they split into two teams and use a computer to get an image of what is in the ground. to finish there are seven main tools used.</p>	1		20131021145002	927	1		20131021152621	926	1

They can also find out about the early American colinists. Their work takes years for just finding out one thing. Archeology is the study of finding out about the past.&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists use many different tools. When they start a dig, a search for artifacts, they use a special shovel called, a slim shovel. It is used to take the thinnest peices of soil. Then they use a trowel, a device that seperates the soil from the artifacts. Archeologists use different tools for different reasons.</p> <p>Archeology is a hard career, but it is amazing what you would find. They use certain tools for different reasons. And they find out about our past. If there weren't any archeologists we wouldn't know anything about our past. &nbsp;</p>	2		20131021095703	535	2		20131021135448	559	2		20131021223447	509	2

They find old ruins and evidence about battles that have taken place. They find skeletons of warriors, cavemen, and so many more. Scientists can study these skeletons and see how they died and other tings that answer questions society has for that specific time period. We have even found Noah's Ark from the Bible.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists find valuable artifacts that help us under stand parts of history. We have found many artifacts in James town that have helped us figure out how they lived, even some of the food them and their pets ate. Also, just by studying the trash from the time period, we know more than we did before about James town. Also, from the fossils we find we can know about many of the species at the time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists find helpful diaries and books. We have found diaries of many presidents and other important people we didn't have much history about before because of archeologists looking in the right places. Also, we have also have found many books such as the bible, we even have the first bible ever made or so people say. We now many things about different time periods because of diaries and books from long ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists find important inventions from long ago. Without archeologists, we wouldn't know how people from long ago wrote, collected water, and much more. Also, they have found many useful things that we would wonder about like, how people sowed and what did they use, where did they store their trash, and these are just a few of the questions I have myself.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists find ancient civilizations. Archeologists have found civilizations such as James Fort, temples, and what used to be great fortresses. By finding these, we now know about the ancient civilizations. We now know about what conditions they lived through, how well they built their structures, and how they survived threw what they did.</p> <p>Also, we also know who or what they worshiped.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists help us understand the past. They help us figure out so much about our peoples history. I hope now you realize how important archeologists are. They help us find valuable artifacts, civilizations, diaries and books, and important inventions.</p>	2		20131022132628	925	2		20131022162610	934	2

They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was began.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefore, it's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was just six years old at the time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>No one knew exactly where the Wahington home was located since the actual building was long gone. However, archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year, but they finally found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They found the main farmhouse a few years later.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>How do the archeologists find all these things that were in Washington's house all those years ago? The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started igging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the dissing is called a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. it can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons. First it gives the citizens of the United States a better understading of who George Washington was before he became famous. We also being to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131021092248	559		N	20131021140839	550		N

I diden't want to be there for a short time. So I stayed there for a longer time than expecting. I got to carve pumcins and eat food. I had so much fun there. When we first got there we had to go throw a corn field to get to the house. It was fun going throw the field. Wants we got there we all grouped up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all learned fun facts about the house and George Washington. We got to see were his bed room was. We all got suveners from the people there. When we went to the playground it was a old playground. It was all made out of wood. No one got to play on it, but we all did get to play on a different playground that wasen't so old.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a great time there but we had to go back to school but it was about 3:30 when we got back to school so he all packed up and went home.

Actually archeologists are people who find things in the past or in history as you call it. Archeologists find dinosaur bones, villages, statues, and many other things. They actually found Fort James and George Washington's house! Read on to know what these people do for a living:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists found many things in the past. For example, Fort James. When they found Fort James it was hard cause the area was underground from storms and floods. What they had to do first was scan the area with computer mapping systems to locate the area. Then they had to finally dig with tools such as picks, shovels, whisks, knifes, skim shovels, trowels, dustpans, and wheelbarrows. It took more than a year and then somebody found a broken down house with the items still in it! They found pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children. Then somebody found the pit on where the settlers at Fort James put their trash in. They found in the pit for example bones from animals which they ate. Soon enough they instantly found villages of houses in the area. Now thats a huge place!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then archeologists had another mission to do finding George Washingtons house. Of course they did the same thing. They started digging in 2003 and then they found it a year later. The buildings they found were a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Soon they found a farmhouse. But after they found their victory nobody believed them. So they had to find some proof. In stories, people say that a fire accured there. The diggers found burnt pottery and ash. That means a fire occured. Also history says that George Washington smoked and they found clay pipes! Soon the discovery was proofed to be the right house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists still do many other things, but thats just some of them. They still are working right now to figure out the past themselves. Let's just hope that this history will still exist.</p>	2		20131022131627	551	2		20131022133553	223	2

Also when he was little is house burned to the ground. when people were searching they knew there were four other houses in the same area so they had to find the right place. Also people had lived on the farm called the Ferry Farm for over 1200 years so thats why they built there home there. Also no one knew where the house was built so it took a while. It took the archilogists a while but when they found the burnt house they knew it was Washingtons.</p>	T		20131022132450	926		T	20131022143016	925		T

An archeologist is a person who digs up artifacts to learn about the past. Archeologists use many different tools to dig up some very important history. The tools these archeologist use are stuff like a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, a trowel and a knife. These tools are very helpful to them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist digs to find something that helps them learn more about the past. Many archeologists can look for objects anywhere. Some look for information about their old life or someone else's.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually archeologists find information on what their trying to look for. Sometimes archeologists can't find what their looking for. Some can find what their looking for in a short time and some can take forever to find what their looking for.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021081534	554	2		20131021091411	926	2

If you think about it, their work is very hard and it takes a lot of work. Archeologists take a lot of time to dig up objects and to study the things that they found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use very special tools to investigate things and to help them dig fossils and other things up. They have to be very careful and concentrate on their work because when they dig things up such as fossils, they could break. They go to special places to investigate and try to find interesting things to try to tell what the past was like in that area. Sometimes, when they dig up something interesting, they can find out how people in the past used to do things.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we should all appreciate the work of an archeologist more than we do because they do very hard work. I hope that in the future, archeologists get a little more credit for what they do. The work that they do is very important and people should congratulate them more often.</p>	2		20131021132636	559	2		20131021134118	223	2

They work hard every day at one poject. They have one job, many tools, and determination.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; One example is from a article called &quot;Finding Fort James&quot;, by Cheryl Bradley. Archeologists searced long and hard to find the outline of the walls to James Fort. They also uncovered many other things, such as cellars, burial sites, and buildings. It took five years to finally uncover the site of the walls. Archeologiss never ave up. They researched the shapes of forts and other important location hints. Other people have found pottery, coins, tools, and toy like objects since the time they had found the outlines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Another example is &quot;Digging up George Washington's Past&quot;. Archeologists had to infer that it was indeed Gearge Washington's house they had found. It took them a long time, but they eventually found the kitchen, slave room, storage rooms, and the farmhouse. They used a mix of different tools to excavate he area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologists use many different tools for many different uses. They first use the skim shovel to remove layers of dirt easily, and then they use trowels and the whisk and dustpan to carefully remove the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; It takes a lot of hard work and teamwork to uncover such big sites. Archeologists are very important in finding out the history of things. Without them, we probably wouldn't know that much about what the Indians made or ancient settling locations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131018150354	551	2		20131021090200	516	2		20131021105345	533	2

It is a mysterious job that can be boring or amazing. i am going to tell you about the job of an archaeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archaeologists get to use all kinds of special tools such as a pick and shovel, a knife, whisk and dustpan, and lots more. There job is to discovery stuff that has been forgotten from the past. For example, if there was dinosaur bones somewhere an archaeologist would go and use his tools to find it. If we didn't have archaeologists then we wouldn't have museums with all the cool stuff.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an Archaeologist is important even if it can be boring just digging for something that you dont know for sure if it even exists, but if we didnt have archaeologists then we wouldnt know as much as we do now about our past.

Over a hundred years later archeologists started a search for the exact spot where Fort James Was. In their search they found dirt markings that were from the wall sourding Fort James. They used all of the tools I listed above. They also found a hole that the Fort James people used to put all of their trash in with animal bones that they ate. The archeologists have comformed that they have found Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists found that George Washington lived in Ferry Farm but their house burt down. Archeologists could not find the house, but the stone base was believed to still be there. They started to dig in 2003 it took over year to find it but they did. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage house. Since the house burned they found remains of burnt pottery. Archeologists comfirmed it was George Washington's house on their computers.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists are awsome people who find remains of history, but sometimes it can be hard to find that history.

Archeologists are people who dig things up from the past,they have dug up alot of stuff bu today I will be talking about Finding Fort James and also Digging up some of George Washington's past. We have plenty to talk about so please get comfortable and enjoy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The finding of Fort James started along time in, 1994. A group of people started a protect called the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Protect.It was made to find out about Jamestown,Virgina.For about 200 year people thought it had been washed up by a river. We know that the for was built around 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.Most people believed it was build by a river so it was easier to dock ships there, so it would make alot of sense why they would pick that area. But, they found items that were farther away from the river.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then after a five year study they finally found James fort! They found marks that indicated were the forts wall would be.Then they found out that the fort was in the shape of a triangle! Then they made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.Then they found out that there were stone legs built over the river that were built to hold cannons. They also found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. Today they found nearly 1,000 objects a year.They found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of what we`ve learned about George Washington is that he was a president and a General to our solders.But we knew nothing about hes childhood. Alot of people lived at Ferry Farm and knew alot about it for about 12,000 years. We also know that George Washington lived on Ferry Farm as well. His father had built their famliey a house there when George was only six years old.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never really knew were the house was because it had fallen a long time ago but we do know he lived there. But the archeologists thought that the stone base was still there, and by 2003 they had finally found it. Then they found the farm house just a few years later. About 4 houses were built on Ferry Farm, so diggers needed to prove that it was George Washington`s farmhouse. Then they soon learned that Washington's house was in a fire, then one day they found burnt pottery and a clay pipe.George Washington smoked clay pipes so they believed it was his. They later found more proof that it was the right house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When they we digging up Washington`s house they had to be very careful not to break anything. It was a very delicate process. They also used 3D computers to track what was underground. They recorded information so they would know what they were looking for when they were digging.&nbsp; Archeologists first used what is called a skim shovel, they are small, flat, and very sharp. The down side to all of this is that is could take up to 2 or even 3 week just to dig a 25-square-foot whole!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this is very important to American history and that's why archeologists want to know more about it. The discovery of George Washington was important because he was our first president and we need to have a better understanding of him. We also want to know how life was like when he was alive. There is also a lot of ways we can learn more. They have activities at Ferry Farm just for kids. I hope you learned a lot today and I hope you learned about archeologists and want they do.

They built a fort that Archeologists were despirate to find. They ended up finding it next to a river where they knew it was at because the boat was settled there next to there home. There in the fort, archeologists found dozen of stuff. Such as, tools, coins and toys for the children. The archeologists can tell that the settlers where starving because there wasnt enough food</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much biographies of George Washengton give information in&nbsp; his childhood. That is why archeologists went looking for his house. The reason they wanted to look for his house is so they get a peice of information of his childhood. When they found it, there was alot of toast (burned) stuff. But they needed proof. So they digged and searched.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was finally a clue.

Their job is to dig up artifacts from the past, so we can learn about history. A lot of archeologists dig to solve mysteries, like when a group of archeologists found Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists wanted to see if they could uncover anything from Fort James. In 1861, the first artifacts were found. They discovered armor and weapons. They also uncovered the floors of buildings. After about 100 years a group effort tried to find the exact spot where Fort James was built. After that, The National Park Service led a 5 year study of the area. They wanted to figure out how the land was used. People used computer mapping software, to create an image of the area. Then they finally found James Fort! A set of marks on the ground was the first thing that they found. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Because of all the stories they had heard and the drawings they had made, archeologists knew that the fort was shaped like a triangle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Other times, archeologists dig to find out how people lived a long time ago. Many archeologists wanted to find out more about George Washington. So, they decided to figure out where he lived, and dig up some things from his past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On Ferry Farm, people have been living there for over 12,000 years. It's a perfect place to build a home. It's not surprising that George Washington's father moved his family there, when George was only 6 years old. George's house was long gone, so no one knew where his actual house was loacated. But archeologists belived that the stone base under the house was still there. In 2003 they started digging. They finally found it, but it took over a year. The kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses, were the first things they found. A few years later, they found the main farmhouse. On the Ferry Farm land, at least 4 other houses, have been built. They needed to find proof that this was George Washington's farmhouse. Records show that in George Washington's house, there was a fire. Burnt pottery was found by the diggers. That probably means that a fire occured there. A clay pipe was also found there. George Washington smoked clay pipes, so there was more proof.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For archeologists to find all of that stuff, they need the right tools. Here are some of the tools that archeolgists use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Pick and Shovel: They are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Whisk and Dustpan: They are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts, and clear away dirt from the excavation site.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Knife: It is used for careful digging, and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Wheelbarrow: It is used to move items form one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excavation site.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Skim Shovel: It is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Trowel: It is probaby the most common tool used in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now you know more about the job of an archeologist. It is much more than just digging in the dirt. They uncover articfacts so we can learn about history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021155500	555	2		20131022104626	560	2

Such as Fort James, and George Washington. Archeologists use tools such as pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They discover artifacts everyday. Some belonged to famous artists, and some belonged to average people. Some common artifacts archeologists find are coins, bullets, old toys, or even pieces of jewelry. Some artifacts might be worth millions, others might be worth nothing, but they are all connected to ancient history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The tools that the archeologists use are very helpful because if they didn't have the tools, and they would have to do it by hand then it would take them double the time it took them with the tools. Using some of the tools isn't always easy and fast to do, but it certainly is cautious. Perhaps the land is unstable and it is an ancient burial site, they would want to disturb them. Though some tools do work fast and is worth digging. The pick and shovel would probably need upper body strength, but it would get the job done. The whisk and dustpan would maybe take a long time to accomplish a find, but once again it would get the job done safely. The knife would get the dirt off around the artifact. The wheelbarrow might be unnecessary to use unless the artifact was to be big for someone to be unable to carry it. They skim shovel would be cautious not to hit something that was not supposed to be hit, because the shovel would be too thin, it can take a thin layer of soil. The trowel would be the most useful tool that the archeologists could use for most parts of their dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Artifacts that are buried in most occasions are either rare, valuable or even a collectable. Archeologists usually find more than one item in one dig session, so the more items they find the more valuable or collectable. Usually people who are more elder have more artifacts, they will usually keep them from their childhood. There are two shows called Pawn Stars, and another on called American Pickers. Both shows buy artifacts from the past, when they buy something they look for things that are rare, valuable, collectable, and even rusty! That's what archeologists usually look for the same thing. They need something that looks like it comes from the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021083527	925	2		20131021094144	563	2		20131021132928	533	1

The information is recorded so people know what it looked like before they started digging.Then their is another team that starts the digging the place where they dig at is called a dig.Those archeologists start digging with what are called skim shovels these shovels are flat, small, and sharp so they can remove thin layers of soil one at a time.That soil is placed in a box with a half screen at the bottom that let's the artifacts stay in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Tools used by Archeologists</b></p> <p>&nbsp;Archeologists use many tools during their work time.One the most common tools they use is the trowel it is used to scrape and cut to view different layers of soil.The pick and the shovel is used to start most digs and to dig into the earth close to artifacts.The whisk and the dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.Then their is the knife it is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.The other type of shovel is called the skim shovel mentioned earlier.

They have found George</p> <p>Washington's past and Fort James. This paragraph is going to be talking about two of those. The first one I will be talking about is George Washington's past. The second one is going to be Fort James. Two paragraphs are going to be about them. Here are the paragraphs about them.</p> <p>Archeologists have found artifacts about George Washington and his past. They</p> <p>started digging in 2003, after a year, they have found it. The first buildings they found was the kitchen, the slave's quarters, and the storage houses, a few years later, they found the main farm house. Archeologists found burnt pottery and a clay pipe. They needed proof that there were four houses built on the Ferry Farm. They also believed that the stone base was under the house, so they went over there to find proof. The Archeologists found many things.</p> <p>It is important that they find George Washington's house.The reason is that, it gives&nbsp;</p> <p>the citizens of the United States a better understandment of who George Washington was before he became famous. Also, to know why he made the decisions he had made. It helps historians learn about the type of life the Colonial Amercians lived like. It helps people know how he lived. Also, it helps them prove that his house was burnt down. Finding George Washington's house is important for many reasons.</p> <p>Archeologists found artifacts about Fort James. They found armor, weapons, and the</p> <p>floors of the buildings. After studying the computer mapping software of the image of the area, they found it. The first things they found were the set of marks on the ground, the marks showed the fort's walls. They also found, eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, ten buildings, pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys children played with. The last thing they found was, trash in an unused well or a big pit in the 1600's because that is ow they lived in Fort James. Archeologists have found things about Fort James in Jamestown, Virgina.</p> <p>It is important that they find artifacts about Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia.</p> <p>It gives us a piece of our past, it ties us to the people who first started the Amercian colonies. Also, Discovering objects that were used reguarly by people who lived hundreds of years ago. The Archeologists know how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe by finding artifacts. Also, we know what the settlers did to survivewhen they had a little bit of food. The Archeologists dug up animal bones that the settlers had ate.</p> <p>Archeologists are important. They helped us find artifacts and helped us</p> <p>discover new things. The artifacts Archeologists found are helpful for history. They can show you different kinds of dinosaur bones. They found artifacts to tell about. Archeologists can find many things hidden underground. Archeologists are important because they can help you and others learn about the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021115613	925	2		20131021131822	563	2		20131022131751	560	2

This may be a tricky job,? but some things you might need to know before if you want to an archeologist if you have to have the patience to work and examine little art fossils or valuable thing that are very rare; you might also need to know a lot about fossils, another thing you will need to know or be if you would like to be an archeologist is you cant be afraid of dirt and mud or dislike it because you will be working with it a lot. Archeologist also have to work with all different types of tools which include picks and shovels, whisks and dust pans, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason you will be working with dirt and mud a lot is when you find fossils you mainly find them in mud or dirt or dust right? They aren't always clean, so when your assignment is to find a fossil your not just gonna walk around and find a fossil you actually have to the work; that involves you have to get you fingers into mud and start digging and trying to find fossils or objects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools that you are going to need if your an archeologist are a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel are used for digging far in to find the fossil because they are so sharp. The whisk and dustpan is used for if the artifact or fossil has dust or mud on it the whisk and dustpan takes it all off so the fossil/artifact is not dirty anymore. The knife is used for cutting around the artifact and getting all the excess mud/dirt off of the artifact. The wheelbarrow is used to carry the fossils from place to place, or to carry the dirt that the archeologists dug through. Because the skim shovel is so thin it is used to take layer by layer off without breaking the mud/dirt so if there is a fossil it doesn't break because the archeologists don't know what layer it can we on.&nbsp; Lastly, the trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of mud/soil to check if they have any fossils or objects in them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022131802	934	1		20131022203418	550	1		20131023133943	560	1

Another group classify the objects.&nbsp; The last group maps the excavation site.&nbsp; Being an archeologist takes lots of team work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin a search for answers from the past, researchers must use evidence from today to find a reasonable place to dig.&nbsp; They do this by taking what they know and putting the knowledge together and getting the approximate location where the artifact is.&nbsp; For example if you are trying to find your favorite toy because you lost it, you would use the information you know to find it.&nbsp; Lets say you know the your little brother really likes your toy, but you never let him play with it, so based on this information you could see if your little brother has it.&nbsp; archeologists also use 3D computers to map what is under them.&nbsp; This is how archeologists find the approximate location of where the artifact they are trying to find is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging for the artifact is hard work because you can not use a big excavator to dig the hole because it might break what you are looking for.&nbsp; Instead you must use tools like the pick and shovel to start your dig, a knife to scrap dirt away from your artifact, a wheelbarrow to carry items and dirt away from the excavation site, you will also use a whisk and dust pan to clean artifacts, a skim shovel is also very handy for removing thin layers of dirt, and finally the trowel which is very important because it can scrape and cut different layers of soil.&nbsp; This process can take weeks, months or even years to find an object that is not fake, and is valuable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an archeologist takes much perseverance, because if you do not find any thing important in your career, you will become very frustrated and you may rage quit.&nbsp; All in all if you are an archeologist it is very rewarding, if you find something important, and it is a great job if you like exploring history.&nbsp; This is what an archeologist does. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021151544	223	2		20131021182346	542	2

What they do is that they go to an old place that has been old for thousands and thousands of years like George Washington's old home. They dig up the valuable things today that have been in Georges life. That's why when it comes to an archeologist, all of us count on him/her to do a very important job.There are also people who research the old place and tell the workers where the stuff is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When the archeologist comes to an old place, the people that are back at the place have to tell the workers what they are digging for and where the things are. The workers want to show proof of where the things are so they can show them that they aren't making this up. So, they use all kinds of different tools like a pick and shovel, a whisk, etc. But, even sometimes the workers give up because they can't find anything. That's why sometimes there are the same things at a museum or nothings there at times. So, when they don't find anything they move onto another spot where something hasn't been discovered or its abandoned. A job of an archeologist is really hard.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The job of an archeologist also needs to have lots and lots of tools to get what they need. Some of the tools are called a whisk, a shovel, a pick, a wheelbarrow, knife, etc. They need these things because they need to dig or to clean the things to show them that they have discovered it. First, you need a whisk because it will help you pick up tiny things or help you clean things off. Second, you need a shovel to dig for the stuff that your looking for. Then, you need a pick for really hard substances like rock or metal. Next, you need a wheelbarrow for collecting all the things an archeologist needed. Lastly, you need a knife to cut off very hard and tiny substances stuck to a valuable thing.The job of an archeologist needs a lot of tools to help get the things they want.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lastly, an archeologist needs to find a location to find where the valuable source is. That job isn't really for an archeologists. Its other workers that stay at the building to find things that are below or in a building or ground. That is when the workers go and dig up the substance so they can either destroy it, or bring it back to their building. An archeologist really relies on the workers at the building because without them, then they wouldn't ever find the substance. So, they always need a worker back at the building to research the place and whats in it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conslusion, a job of an archeologist is very hard to do and very hard to cooperate with, but with the right kind of tools and people, a job of an archeologist is very fun sometimes.</p>	2		20131021115750	926	2		20131021145013	927	1		20131021221553	509	2

Archeologists study histories as they dig up the past centuries. Their jobs are tough, but they discover many treasures as they use their tools as a friend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, archeologists use their computer software to map the contents of the ground. These are very helpful by helping archeologists find where to make the site for digging. It's very important because then they know where to start and where the historical things are hidden and how it will look like.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the archeologists start digging the ground with their flat skim shovel, which can move layers of soil at a time. The removed soils are placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom, which lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, archeologists use a process called troweling, which is when they use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifacts. Plus, it can take up two whole weeks to dig a 25-square-foot-section! Anyways, while this team is working, the another group archeologists can study found objects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, a job of archeologists might be tiring and slow, the history treasure they find is worth the hard work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021093321	925	2		20131021103606	563	2

Well then, keep listening, because this report will tell you all about the job of an archeologist. I will tell you the different jobs of an archeologist and the tools that archeologist use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To start off, there are two different jobs of an archeologist. The first job is the digging job. In this phase, you take small amounts of dirt and place it onto a &frac12;&quot; screen that separates dirt from artifacts. If there are any artifacts, you would take it over t??o the second job, the computer job. In this job, you would scan the artifact and also look at the &frac12;&quot; screen and see if any small artifacts fall with the dirt. You would see the screen on your computer. The artifacts that you scan will appear on your computer and then you can find out what it is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another important thing to know as an archeologist is what tools you use. There are six tools that they use. The first one is the pick and shovel. Most digging places start with these tools. They can help take away dirt around the artifact that they are currently looking at. The next tool is the whisk and dustpan. These two tools help to clean artifacts that archeologist find. Next, there is a knife. This tool is used to scrape dirt off artifacts. After that, there is the wheelbarrow. This helps archeologist move artifacts and move dirt away from the area. Also, there is the skim shovel. This strange shovel has a flat edge and is used to remove a thin layer of soil. Finally, there is the trowel. This is used to scrape ant cut to view different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I hope you have learned about what an archeologist does. Do you want to become an archeologist?</p>	1		20131021135812	223	2		20131021192455	563	2		20131022153312	533	1

Exciting, would it be? That's exactly what an archeologist does as a job. Archaeologists find new and unique artifact in different places, send them to the study labs,&nbsp; and research more about that object. If you want to know more about these amazing world-traveled artifact hunters, read on!&nbsp; Archeologists are very detailed and specific in whatever they do. They can sometimes use objects as big as wheelbarrows to dig soil to tiny wood picks for chipping of soil of very fragile objects. There are a lot of steps in digging up fossils and artifacts of the past. They first have to get together and entire team, which can take up to thirty-five people!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; First of all, the first team maps the area using 3D that can track what is underground. The information is recorded on a piece of paper so everyone one can get a visual look about how the place was before they started to dig up the ground. Archeologists find many artifacts and materials that will show the past of the specific place. In this year, we have learned about a famous historical person named George Washington. There wasn't much information about where he lived and things about it. We wondered about what stuff and information was lying behind this historical man's childhood home. Coincidentally, we figured out that archeologists also had the same exact question! Some archeologists were digging at the dig to see if anything that was left behind was still right underneath the soil. One archeologist was digging and met a clay tube in the way. He thought about George Washington and remembered that he used clay tubes to smoke. This evidence proves that he was searching the correct place!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Furthermore, archaeologists have gone all around the world studying about its history and artifacts. They gone to Egypt to study tombs, pharaohs, and much more. They go into tobs and try to find as much as they can. They sometimes will also remove the tombs and study the precious wealth the body has been kept with. If lucky, they are allowed to unwrap the body to get a more detailed view of what the past was like when they were alive. They have also visited King's Valley to discover the dinosaur fossils. Using fine and detailed marterial, they easily find the truth and information of the life before us.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Being an archeologist can be hard work, but worth it. Now after learning about them, we should be thankful to them for helping us humans study the world and its past more clearly and thoughtfully. What are you waiting for, get out and start digging! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022120140	535	2		20131022164812	926	2

But at the same time it could be fun because you could have a lucky day and find alot of things. An archeologist is a very important job for several reasons like, if we didn't have a archeologist history wouldn't be as powerful than today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists need a lot of tools specially pick and shovel the most important tool = used to dig to find artifacts, whisk and dustpan = they need these tools to brush the dirt off artifacts to make it more visible, knife = used for scrape dirt of the artifacts basicallly a whisk and dust pan, wheelbarrow is also a big use for diggers= helps remove heavy artifacts to a office to study, skim shovel = a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of dirt, and finally a trowel the trowel is the most common tool in archeology = used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you read more about an archeologist it is a very hard, fun job to do.

First off, life being an archeologist is not<b> ever</b> easy and with artifacts you must handle them very carfully. Any time your holding a artifact you may be holding a million dollars. Second you must work in any weather, from hail to heat you still keep working. So that is why you use presise tools to dig them up.</p> <p>Tools are very important archeologists don't use huge vehicles to dig. That would ruin every artifact in the ground! So instead people use miny brooms and shovels big and small. These let us find&nbsp; artifacts in good conditions so we can reaserch them. Now not all archeologists work in the field.</p> <p>Some archeologists work with computers and with teams. These teams try and reasearch artifacts and what they were. Some teams have alot of people working together, sometimes up to 35. All of this takes a long time, in the fields it would take 14 days to dig 25 square foot holes. The job of an archeologist is complicated, long and time consuming sometimes you don't find anything. For some reason though many people enjoy working as an archeologist.</p>	1		20131021083527	925	2		20131021094144	563	2		20131021132928	533	1

They get to use cool equipment to find things underground. To be an archeologist is a very hard but fun job. Your in charge of finding the history of so many magnificent things , which can be a big responsibility at sometimes. Archeologists will travel to places around the world to figure out its history. To get history you usually spit up in groups one for digging and the other one for actual digging. Archeologists have an important jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994 a group of people interested in history started an archaeological project called the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was made to find out the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. Over 200 years ago people assumed that it had been flooded or washed away by a river, but some discovery's made proof it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607 when the settler came from England to have a better life. It was a good hide out from enemy and the boats are so close, so they docked them right there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1861 the first object was found, they were armor, weapons and the floor of buildings. 100 years later they were on a mission to find the spot where the fort was built started. A National Park lead a study to figure out how the land was used. They started the computer to map out everything. That's when they finally found James Fort. From mark to mark the secret unraveled. So it turned out that after a couple hundred years it is possible to find interesting artifacts from way back.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington is so interesting, but facts we know about him now are mostly about his time as the president and as a soldier. So some Archaeologists have set out to find more information on George Washington and about his childhood. When George Washington was six his father moved their family to Ferry Farm. It took the Archeologists over a year but they found the main base of the house. The Archeologists found some burnt pottery and part of a clay pipe the Archeologists knew that George Washington smoked clay pipes. So they had proof it was his house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have very hard jobs, but it also must be very interesting to be an Archeologist. They get to explore things no one has explored before and find out secrets about people and landmarks. Even though it takes a little while to find out those secrets and discoveries, it must be really worth it&nbsp; It really must be amazing to be an Archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022094221	927	2		20131022104707	925	2		20131023094056	560	2

Before they start to dig they get into a team and that team maps the area using 3D computers.Then when they are done another them starts digging in the ground.When they find a artifact in the ground they use a box with a halh-inch screen at the bottom.That way the dirt will fall out and the artifact or artifacts will stay in the box.Then they will study the artifact or artifacts in the box.</p> <p>&nbsp; Well, i leared that they have a tough job to do at the site.Since they have to make sure that they know how to use the tools.If they did not they would hurt people around them and&nbsp; hurt themself.They also have to map the area out first so they know what is in the ground.And after they see what is in the ground they can start digging.So when they find what they are looking they can study it, and find out what it is and find out what it does.</p>	2		20131021113127	926	2		20131021133339	542	2

What an &nbsp;archeologist does is that they look for things from the past, like acient tools and dinosaur bones.The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery. They suggested that a fire occured.They also found part of a clay pipe, Washington smoked a clay pipe.Archeologist can have up to 35 people on thier team.The first team mps out the area using a 3D computer, that can track what is underground. The next teamjust focuses on the digging.Those archeologist start the dig with what is called a skim shovel. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, at one time. The dirt is placed in a box with a half-inch screem at the bottom.This lets the dirt fall out, but the artifacts to stay in.Also, the diggers use a process&nbsp;called troweling. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, pait brushes, and wooded picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studing the objects that are found. Ferry Farms offers many opportunities for kids to get involved. Kids can expore the site, experience colonial life, and becaome aa junior archeologist.Digging around in dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at Ferry Farms are bringing to life the county's first president in ways we have never seen. This is what an archeologist does.</b></p>	1		20131022131627	551	1		20131022133553	223	1

Archeologiosts do have to be careful&nbsp;and try to find something, not listening to what all people say.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The work of archeologists is important. &nbsp;The archeologists have uncovered secrets and found many things. &nbsp;Thanks to the work of arceologists, we now havelearned many new things from the past.</p>	2		20131022103640	547	2		20131022113647	563	2

Once they study them they find out thing about them. Sometimes these artifacts can be very valuble. There are 35 on a team on a siteor area to dig up artifacts. The first team maps the site or area with 3D computers that can track underground , this means they take the 3D computer underground so they can see maybe if there is any artifacts under the ground. The information is wrote down, so people know what it looks like before they start digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another team does the digging and the place the team is digging is called a dig.</p> <p>Archeologists start their dig with a skim shovel , this is one of many tools they use to dig. It removes layrs of soil. this soil is put into a half-inch screen at the bottom.This lets the dirt fall out and the artifacts stay in. Troweling is another tool they use to dig with. It can take weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section. This is a long process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another Team spends days in the lab studying the things that are found.</p> <p>This is a long, slow, and tiresome process. But when when it is done it is all worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Digging in dirt just to play and get dirty is one one thing, but when u dig for</p> <p>artifacts that can be studied and can maybe be found very valuable, and just amazing to find and learn more about it. So get involved and dig , to find things about someone or thing that no one has ever seen. So get digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022130752	223	2		20131022143645	926	2

They dig-ed up stuff about Fort James and George Washington.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fort James was very famous for over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. Most people think that James Fort was built near a river. The archaeological dig-ed up bones from the animals they ate and the trash they threw away. The archaeological found eleven cellars , dozens of burial sites , and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington was super famous because he was the predestine they started digging up stuff about him in 2003.

This paper will explore what they do,what teams are, and the tools they use and how they use the tools. There are many other things that an acheologists do, but these are main ones this paper is about. Lets get started!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists study things that happened in the past. Archeologists are scientists. &nbsp; They work many hours a day to dicover things that happen the past. They have to work as a team.</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologists are in a team and each team does something else. One team takes a 3D picture under ground so the other team isn't just digging. Another team digs and takes it to the team in a lab. That team studies the artifacts. There can be up to 35 people in a team!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologits many tools like a pick and a shovel. A pick and a shovel helps them dig into Earth. There is also the whisk and the dust pan. They use them to dust of the artifacts. They also use a knife which is used to carefully for digging and to scrape the arifacts. There is a wheelborrow that is used for transportating the artifacts, a skim shovel that is used for carefully remove a thin layer of dirt, and trowel that is used to scrape and cut a view the the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what an archeolegists does. Rember this paper explored what they do, what is a team, and what tools they use and how they use them. I learned that that an archeologists that an acheologist used a wheelborrow and that they used a knife.

An artifact is a object like a pottery, bones, armor, and many more, so an artifact is simplely an object from the past. Some of the things they use are picks, shovels, whisk, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Most archeologist use picks and shovels to dig deep into the ground because most artifacts are deep in the ground. Next, they use a whisk and a dustpan to dust off dirt on the artifacts. Also, they will use knifes to also get dirt off mort fagile things. Another tool is the wheelbarrow to move heavy loads of dirt and artifacts from one place to another. One other thing is that they use skim shovels to remove thin layers of soil because it has a flat egde. Lastly, they use the trowel to cut different layers of soil. these are all the tools archeologist use.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing I will talk about are what the jobs of an archeologist are. On a full team they have to have at least 35 people. The first team of people work on computers in 3D so they can see what is under the ground. Then this team sends the maps to the digging team. The 2nd team works on the digging. They first use the skim shovels to get the first layers.</p>	2		20131018144318	934	2		20131018154727	926	2

An archeologist will work with a group of other people and this group can be up to 35 people! Computers can see what is underground. A way the archeologists dig up stuff is trowling. Trowling is when you use shovels, picks or paint brushes to remove dirt.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use interesting tools to dig. One tool an archeologist uses is called a pick. the pick is used to break up soil. A tool that goes with the pick is the shovel. The shovel can pick up the dirt the pick breaks up. The knife is another tool that is used to scrape dirt form the object.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other process is that they use the shovel to pour dirt into a half inch sceen so the dirt slips through screen while the objects stay behind on the screen. The archeologists record the information that they find. It ca take up to 2 weeks to dig up a 25 square-foot section! the process is slow but it's worth it.</p>	2		20131021151544	223	2		20131021182346	542	2

It would be a great job</p> <p>for people who love history. An archeologist is someone who finds items from long ago. These items are called artifacts. As an archeologist you get to uncover items from the past. I think that it would be fun because you're just digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists are very smart people. They have to really know their history.Archeologists have 3-D computers so they can find items without digging so much.The computers also tell archeologists what the object looks like so they know they have the right thing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd imagine that doing this would be very time consuming also. You wouln't&nbsp; have much time to spend with your families. Most archeologist are gone for weeks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists probably have a lot of time on their hands because they are gone for a long time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist are also very unselfish people because they could take the artifacts and pocket them for themselves. Then they could sell them for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've ever wondered what happens with the artifacts.Well the archeologists take them and get them cleaned.Then most of the time they get put in museums for the public to see and study.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the tools are very important. The whisk is a broom like item that sweeps all of the dirt off an artifact. The skim shovel is a flat shovel that can shovel and dig layers af dirt at a time so that they don't miss anything.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an archeologist would be an adventure I think. You are going to new places and finding things from the past. You are also solving a mystery for those who don't know about yet.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to be an archeologist!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131018144947	926	2		20131018152611	542	2		20131018160128	533	1

Archeologists find fossils so we can learn about the past and so we can learn about people from the past. One key thing to digging is that you have to be pastiont with that. You may not find something in every hole but you need to keep digging and you will find something. Discoveries are what helps us find out thing from the past. You can find even where houses use to be.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; People need to know&nbsp; things about the past and archeologists can help us do that.

First lets talk about James fort, Virginia. James fort was found in 1607, for over 200 years ( in the resent past PROBABLY about 2004 ) people have thought that Fort James was washed up by river.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The archeologists found their first artifact in 1861, it was armor and weapons. 100 years later they found where the fort was built. A national park service did a five year study of the area. <u>BUT THEY FOUND JAMES FORT!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; First they found a few markings on the ground, that's how they knew where the walls used to be. the archeologists knew that the fort was shaped like a triangle, then they realized that the fort stretched all the way out to the river, and there was stone ledges built over the the river and they were meant to hold cannons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Today, the same archeologists have found almost 1 million objects every year!! ( coins, pottery, tools and metal toys for children ) It is exciting to discover things from a long period of time in the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So now we have gotten to learn about what Archeologists actually do, and what amazing things they can find, so now lets talk about George Washington.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington was the commander and chief of the continental soldiers in the Revolutionary War in the 17 hundreds. After the war George Washington refused to be crowned king so they made him the 1st president of the United States Of America, But does anyone know his real childhood? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In a place called Ferry Farm people have been living there for over 12,000 years! It is a perfect place to build a home so, of cores George's father Augustine moved there as well. George Washington was only six years old. The house was gone of cores but archeologists believe that the stone base under the house was still around. It took over one year to find the house. First they found the kitchen, slave quarters and storage houses. They found the farmhouse a few years later though. At least four other houses were built on Ferry Farm so they have to prove that this was George Washington's house/farm. They found part of a clay pipe, because we would smoke clay pipes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;For the diggers it took about two weeks to make a twenty five square foot section! The discoveries of Washington's home is important in many ways, like it give the people A better understanding of his past.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;So we just looked at two major things including George Washington and James Fort but you actually know what tools archeologists use? first they will usually use a pick and shovel to dig into the earth. They will also use a whisk and a dustpan to clean off the artifacts, or a knife to dig carefully around the artifact. The leftover dirt is placed in a wheelbarrow and is taken away from the excavation site. To also dig they use a skim shovel or a trowel one removes a thin layer of dirt and another scrapes and cuts the dirt to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; So now you know about what archeologists do and how they do it.</p>	1		20131022111359	535	2		20131022130707	516	1		20131023161625	509	1

You will need a pick and shovel for digging, and you have to dig sometimes to find an item. Also you might use a whisk and dustpan, you need a whisk and dutpan for brushing off dust or soil off of the item that you found. A dustpan is used for maybe having a tiny particle and you can look at it closely.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be an archeologist it does take some skill. such as using the tools properly, also researching what you have found. I think being an archeologist would be a very cool job. Why do I say that? Well you get to find and also research really cool and old items. Sometimes the item might of been owned by a very famous person once before. That is why I think being an archeologist would be a very cool job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021154550	927	1		20131021160107	223	1

Well if you're not up for tedious work, it might not be the job for you.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many teams can work on a site, and there can be up to 35 people on a single team. That means if there were only three teams, there could already be more than a hundred people! However, before the digging even starts, the first team has to map out the area with 3D computers so that people after them will know what the site looked like before the digging started.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual process of digging is long and back-breaking. The dig is started with small shovels that are called skim shovels. Skim shovels are extremely sharp and flat, so they are able to remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then screened - the soil is put in a box with a screen so that the dirt falls out and the artifacts stay in .</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another process that diggers use is troweling. Troweling archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to get rid of dirt. Troweling is extremely slow, however. It can take up to two weeks to dig a small 25-square-foot area!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts that are found to find out what they mean and how they are important to our history.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021141345	555	2		20131021180538	695	2		20131022154635	516	1

Some of the reasons the job of an archeologist is a hard job, is because archeologist have to observe and study artifacts about history. An archeologist is a scientist who observes and studies artifact from the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The job of an archeologist helps the community by collecting artifacts from past. There are many tools used by an archeologist. Those tools used by an archeologist are important, because those tools help the archeologist develop and move on with the job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologist study and observe many artifacts, such as fossils, bones, and most of all extincted dinosaurs.

It usually takes several months just to find out about one person's life. Although it doesn't seem like a lot of hard work, it is plentiful for the history diggers.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why do they do it? The archeologists do it because they want to know more about how the old legends lived, like George Washington.They also do it so the world can know. The history searchers find many interesting tools, clothes, and almost anything that can tell them how they lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists work in many groups and each group has a special purpose. On each team, there can be as many as 35 people!One team maps out an area using a 3D computer so they can track what is underground. The other team digs on the selected area which is called the dig.The archeologists start digging with skim shovels that remove thin layers of dirt. the soil is placed in a box with a thin screen on the bottom. that lets the dirt fall out and allows the artifacts appear. The diggers also use a process called troweling, which is when archeologists use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It almost takes two weeks to dig a 25-square foot area. After all that, another team studies the artifacts in a lab.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The archeologist's job is very tiresome but releases a lot of information. Because of the archeologists, we know all the history that we know today.</p>	2		20131018145933	546	2		20131018184202	927	2

Archeologists, the name for sciencetists who study objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of&nbsp; buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a five- year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping softwere to make an image of the area. That's when they finally found james fort! The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between all the stories they heard and read , and drawings they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort was stretched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons.

A whisk and dustpan is used to brush of dirt from the artifacts that archeologists find. There are many other tools used and they all have a very important role in digging up artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a archeologist you must have a lot of patience!

An archeologist must be very careful when doing his or her job. There are many tools that archeologists use in their work to get the job done, and archeologists find more artifacts each day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools that an archeologist uses are very important. One of the most common tools used is a trowel. Trowels are used to scrape, cut, and view the layers of soil. Another tool used is a knife. Knives are used to cut dirt from around an artifact. A pick and shovel is also a tool that archeologists use. Most archeologists start digging with these.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; There are more tools archeologists use, also. For instance, they use whisks and dustpans. Whisks and dustpans are to brush off dirt from artifacts and excavation sites. Archeologists use wheelbarrows, too. Wheelbarrowsare used to carry off items or dirt to one place to another. Another tool used is a skim shovel. They have very flat edges that can carefully scope away dirt. These tools are not the only tools that archeologists use, there are still many, many more!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many duties an archeologist must do, aswell. At an excavation site called Ferry Farms, groups of archeologists have been finding artifacts from George Washington's house! At Ferry Farms, there is at least thirty- five archeologists in one group. That's a lot of people! One group of archeologists will scope out an area by using 3D computers to see what's underground. Then they record the information so people will know what to expect when they start digging in that area. Another team focuses on digging, they call the place where they do the digging a dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The teams at Ferry Farms have found kitchens, slave quarters, and storage houses in 2004. Later, they found the main farmhouse. They also found pieces of burnt pottery and parts of clay pipes. Still today Ferry Farms is finding more and more artifacts from long ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994, a group of archeologists that called themselves the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was made to find James Fort. People said that the fort had been washed away, but the project found clues that the fort was still around.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Park Service studied the area that was the exact place the fort had been built for five years. they tried to find out how the land was used. This helped them decide where to look for the fort. Soon after, James Fort was found! Marks on the ground showed where the walls had been, and there were also stone ledges that were built to hold cannons. Cellars, burial sites, and buildings were all found by the archeologists. Today, the group finds about one million artifacts a year!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Being an archeologist sounds like an amazing job! The tools seem fun to use. You can find great things if you just look hard enough and thats what archeologists do! This discovers more history than ever before!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131018153225	516	1		20131021084008	925	2		20131021105345	533	2

They have to find things that have been buried for a very lond time. Some things they look for have been there for decades, or maybe even centeries! Their job is hard becuse when they find what the're looking for they have to send it to a lab, make sure it does't get broke, and a lot of other things that are hard to do for a person. The things they dig for are called artifacts and if old and valuable can be very important.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeoligists can look for some artifacts for years. Sometimes there is know guarentee they will find it. There are many different tools a archeoligist can use. Eight of them are the pick, a shovel, a whisk, a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skimshovel, and a trowel. These tools are very important to the archeoligists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some organizations for other kids or people that want to get involved with digging up artifacts. Ferry Farms for example helps get kids involved. The steps an archeoligist has to take when he discovers something is, be careful with the object he or she has found, take it back to the lab, leave it there for the workers to study, and then go and find more stuff. archeoligists can be called to many different places. Some places are far from where they live and they can be gone for a long time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeoligists have a hard job, but it could be fun, finding new things that people used long ago. If you want even you can be an archeoligist. Archeoligists are good for the community because they help us find out more about people from the past. If we find out about people from the past it could make us smarter. Archeoligists are brave and Should be respected for what they do to help us find out about other people from long ago.</p>	2		20131022112131	547	1		20131022142049	535	2		20131023100715	560	2

Whisk and Dustpan used to brush off dirt from artifacts and to clear away dirt from a excavation site.Knifes used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from artifacts.Wheelbarrow used to move items from one place to another and to carry dirt.Skim Shovel a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil.The Trowel the most common tool in archeology used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.Archeologist will also look into places like deserts,caves,and mountains and many more!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This job seems hard but is really worth it in the end.But if you try hard enough you could discover something new.But if you don't like being outside then you could search old houses like in the article of <u>Digging up George Washington's Past.</u>A archeologist can find many things and unclog the past and we could learn more about that era.

When they look for artifacts there are teams that do a special job. First one crew maps out the area using 3D computers so they can track things underground. After they find a spot to dig another group starts to dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diggers use tools to help them. One is a shovel and pick, most digs start with these tools until they get far enough to the artifacts. They use the wheelbarrow to carry dirt or other things to a different place. They use also use a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of soil. They use the whisk dustpan and knife to carefully remove soil or brush dirt off an artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist does this to discover the past and find cool things from back then.They have to have an idea where something might be before they start the steps. Depending where and what your digging for is what you get, if you dig where Benjamin Franklin lived as a child then you might find books of that time or maybe even something he wrote.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an archeologist would be fun if only because you discover the past but you get to go place famous people were. But it would be very tiring digging it up and having to stare at a computer all day is tiring. Also it is an all day job it is not only for an hour or two. Also that would be bad if all day you did nothing but dig and you found nothing but dirt, dirt, and more dirt. But it is fun to find what you want to find and more.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists could find anything with today's tech. They can find things from Indians from conditional time and prehistoric times.They get to use the highest tech, if i were a archeologist I would be using the computer.As I see it being an Archeologist is fun but also very tiring.</p>	1		20131022105519	559	1		20131022111147	223	1

They used matirals like a pick and sonel for digging it&nbsp; out of the rocks an digging in the dirt to find bones and o ther stuff. They used whisk and dustpan&nbsp; to brush away the sand or dirt to see the artifact better. They used a knife for&nbsp; scraping around the artifact. And Etc. These people go into famous nonalive people and look for really cool artifacts like jewlery and clothes and matirals that are something meaningful to them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they also go out in the forest and look for dead animal remains or sometimes even music&nbsp; clothes and other stuff like that. And also old barns for clothes animal remains and that thing you find in a barn. And maybe at&nbsp; mountians to dig in the mountians maybe find a moumths remains. And in&nbsp; the river for other reamins and stuss . There is many places you can find remains. And really cool stuff about people of the past and our history of this country to us.These peole also put stuff in the muesem so peple can see what is it all about and were it came from. And also about the era that thing had or person lived and experinaced. And what the peole were doing it and why they did it.

So to find artifacts you must have the following tools used by archeologists: A pick and a shovel which most digs start with these two tools and there used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Some other tools archeologists use would be a whisk and dustpan which is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Also a knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts, A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Also a skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Now this tool would be probably the most common tool an archeologist would use which is a trowel and it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. These are the tools archeologists used while finding artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is a quick story of some archeologists working at George Washington's house to find artifacts about him. When they go out to find artifacts about him they go to his house from a long time ago, and they found burnt pottery, then this suggests a fire occured there. They also found a clay pipe, they found a clay pipe because Washington smoked clay pipes, so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house. So thats what archeologists do, they discover artifacts of people long ago. They want to know about there history.</p>	2		20131022132230	550	2		20131022161509	547	2

It also gives us a better understanding of who the person was before he or she was famous. Also they could find out some great artifact that no one has ever found before. It is very interesting to learn about things in the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The job of an archeologist is tiresome it's hard work because archeologists have to do a lot of thinking on the thing that they're working on. There are 2 teams with about 35 people in the group. Each team has there own job one group is called a dig and there the ones that will dig up the artifact with skim shovels some of the diggers use a process called Toweling and that's when the archeologists would use wooden pickaxes, small shovels, and paint brushes. Another team would first use a 3D computer to track what would be underground. Sometimes when archeologists would go out digging they could find out something they've never known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of times archeologists don't really know where the person's house was so the archeologists would have to gather up all of there information and find out where the house used to be. Most of the time archeologists have to use there knowledge. Also archeologists sometimes have to do sketches of the building if they were doing one to see where the building or fort could have been. Lots of times archeologists have to read books to see where the building could have been located they were putting more information on the thing they were researching about. Some people thought that the James Fort was washed away by a river but they found out that it still might be there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was my informational report about archeologist and there job. An archeologists is and awesome job and one day I hope to be one. Also it would be very fun to go out and dig up artifacts from long ago. It also teaches you something. Plus archeologists get to use awesome tools and get to dig up things from the past.</p>	2		20131021192241	696	2		20131022095143	925	2

These tools are very important tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fourth paragraph is about a skim shovel and a trowel and what they do.&nbsp; A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.&nbsp; A trowel is a sharp hand held shovel that is probably the most common tool in archeology. It's used for scraping and cutting to view the different layers of soil. These to tools are most common and most used while an archeologist is working.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many jobs in order to be an archeologist so that's why there are so many tools to help dig up artifacts so that people who want to know about people they can.

Then they have to graft and then they have to dig ya that is allot of work. The tools they use are like the size of a tooth pick.

One thing I know is what they study. In 1994 a group was doing this Archaeolgical project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project was to discover the secrets of the james Fort in jamstown, It was a big project they had to do. Now I am going to tell you what it is like being a Archeologist. One thing A Archeologist does is they find a lot of things that were in Washington's house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year many teams will work on a site. There could be up to 35 people on a team! The team tried to find James Fort. The national park service had a fiver year old study of the area to figure out how land was used. They throught that it would help them decide where to look for proof. They used a type of thing on a computer to make an image of the area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's when they finally found James Fort! The first they found was a set&nbsp; marks on the ground . Those marks&nbsp; showed where the fort's walls used to be. The archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They also made maps and stuff to even help them find James Fort. The archeologists used tools to. But this is not part of the big job that is over.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to tell some of the tools they used. Knife used for digging and scraping. Trowel also used for scraping and cutting. Wheelbarrow is used for moving items one place to another and carrying. Pick used for digging into hard objects close to the artifacts. That is all the tools there is more but this is all im going to tell thanks for listening.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021131732	695	1		20131021200827	551	0		20131022134721	560	1

An archeologist has to be very careful about where they dig.Archiologists have recently found George Washington and they have to know about the things that might have happend a long time ago.They have also recently ound Fort James.They must use presition and hope not to hit or break any thing usefull or in value of there job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They ushaly will dig out very big parts of the earth to find things. Archologests uhshaly use shovels and wooden pickaxes to get rid of layers of dirt.All of the axes dirt will be put into a wellbarow.sence the founding of Gorges childhood home we have leard&nbsp; alot about his chiled hood and what happend whene he was even younger.The founding of Fort James would show what happend whene the spanish came in the 1600's they built it then hundreds of years later arciologists found armor and the trash that they would throw away they always thought that before any one found it that it was washed away by a river and was long gone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They look at the atifacts they find in 3D computers to judge what it is. Most arciologists are very smart but you have to be because if you sont know anythig about the artifacts you might think it is just a peice of tras and throw it off the mountain your on or something.If you didn't know what to do you would allways look at it for 20min. and then put back a 100,000,000 year old Dinosoaur bone.</p>	0		20131021095247	926	1		20131021114300	554	1		20131022095450	560	0

They also have to find artifacts or old pieces of history to help us understand what really happened in history. An archeologist also has to be very careful and patient. It could take months just to find out a toy that George Washington played with.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist also have to be ready to get down and dirty. They get very dirty when they are in the dirt all day long. Also they have to be careful. If they are not careful they might break the artifacts. Archaeologist also have to be very smart and know where things came from. They also have to be interested in history or they probably wont like their job. If you don't like dirt you wont like you job either. An archeologist also has to study what they have found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also have to like to learn about history or else they might find their job to be very boring. It is very important that they are careful and they can't just dig in the ground super fast because it might break one of the objects. They also would need many years of practice to be able to find objects over one hundreds years old and not break them. I think it would be hard to be an archeologist because I might drop or break one of the objects.</p>	2		20131018151027	550	2		20131018154429	547	2		20131018202938	509	2

Archeologists help use know what the past use to be and how show things that came from that past. They use have programs on there computers that can help them find that on maps that aren't shown on other maps. This helps the archeologists find where that spot can be. Finding these place can be hard and very tricky to some archeologists out there. Archeologists have to take notes and find pictures to help them find it and then finally they go to that spot and find them with knifes and shovels. Some of the places can be in very small places that nobody found in a long time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they get there they search for shovels to find things that must have to have been left from the ground. There are teams found so they can found all of those things and there are up to 35 people in one group. Without archeologists, we could could not find things from the past and what happened to them. An archeologists is someone who finds artifacts from the past. They are the very first people to find something that is old and that has never been discovered before. As soon as the archeologists find the right materials, they go back to and see anything that could have happened to them. The maps they use are much different then the way people use them today and they better at finding things than we are. Some inportant things for an archeologists are fossils that have things carved on them from ages ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists need as much things as possible to be able to find bones, teeth, and fossils. Archeologists use wheelbarrows to find to carry a lot of dirt out of the way for finding these bones that are deep in the ground. As they find these artifacts they bring to people at museums and they get paid a lot for all the hard work that they have done. A knife is used to scrap dirt off of the the artifact or fossil that has been found so the archeologists can see it more clearly. A trowl is inportant for fro archeology because you have to scrap and cut different layers of the soil. Most importantly you need a whisk and a dustpan is to clear the site and brush off dirt from the artifacts. This is an archeologists job.</p>	1		20131021095703	535	1		20131021135448	559	1

An archeologist uses special tools to help them find the artifacts. Archeologists work is very hard but its worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the tools an archeologist uses is a pick and a shovel. The pick and the shovel are used to dig into the earth to get to the artifacts. A whisk and a dustpan&nbsp; are other tools used to get the dirt off&nbsp; the artifacts. A knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel are also some other tools an archeologist needs or uses to find artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find out about a persons past or childhood an archeologist has to find the place where that person lived or where they spent their childhood. Then the archeologists start their digging and start looking around to look for more clues. When they find the artifacts they use the whisk to dust off the dirt. The archeologists then keep looking until they find enough artifacts to find out about the past or the childhood of the person.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion a person who studies artifacts an archeologist. The tools the archeologists use to find the artifacts are special. It&nbsp; takes the archeologist a very long time and hard work to find the artifacts but in the end they succeed and find out about the person they are studying.</p>	2		20131022130557	696	2		20131022142033	535	2

There they found George W.'s house. To comfirm that the house was where George had lived as a child, they examied for any signs of burnt things because records show that the Washingtons had their house on fire.They finally found pieces of burnt pottery,but that was still not enough for the archeologist. They know that George smoked clay pipes.Later they found some clay pipes that were smoked. The archeologist were later digging for artfacts.They used methods such as Troweling and used tools like a whisk and a dutst pan,a skim shovel,Trowels, and pickaxes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclustion, Archeology helps people understand about America's past and things that were used by different&nbsp; people.Expditions such as Ferry Farm and Fort James are great examples of what archeologist do and the artfacts they find that were once used by well-known people and groups like George Washington or Fort James.Artfacts tells us what that happened thousands of years ago that we dont know about.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131018190546	542	2		20131018213239	509	2

Also in<b><u> Digging up George Washington's Past</u></b>, archeologists were able to discover George Washington's home that he had as a boy. Archeologists do a lot of reaserch.

They have to use special tools and work carefully so they do not damage the artifact. One tool they use is called a Skim Shovel. This is a shovel with a flat edge. Archeologists use this tool to remove thin layers of soil with every scoop. The next tool is a trowel. It is said to be the most used tool in archeology. Archeologists use it to scrape the soil to view it differently. Archeologists also use a knife a lot. They can it for more careful digging. It is also useful to scrape dirt from artifacts. Those tools are not the only ones an archeologist would use. There are still many more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>What archeologists discover</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021160057	925	2		20131022103047	559	2		20131023084017	533	2

You need many different tools to go digging for artifacts. Also, you can't dig up an artifact overnight. It takes a lot of work. Archeologists have to map out the area that they want to dig and use 3D computers to track what's underground. Being an archeologist is no piece of cake, but you can benefit in many ways.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once on the digging site, archeologists use many different kinds of tools to find what they are looking for. Skim shovels are used to take off a very small layer of dirt with each dig. Picks and shovels are used to dig deep to find artifacts. Knives are used to scrape dirt off artifacts and to do careful digging.Trowels are used to view the different layers of soil at a digging site. Whisks are used to brush away extra dirt, and wheelbarrows are used to move artifacts from one place to another.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeology isn't a walk in the park, but without it we would not know a lot about the past and the hardships that people went through. Not much would be known about anything! Without archeology, we would know nothing about our ancestors, so get out there and start digging!</p>	2		20131021152301	542	2		20131021154438	927	2

If you have dug up something from the ground before the proses in which you do this is called Archeology. Archeology is the study of objects from the past. If you study the objects you are called a archeologist. For many people Archeology is a treasured perfection.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1994 a bunch of people who find studying the past entertaining formed a group called the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. The project was started to recover&nbsp; the secrets of the Jamestown Fort in Virginia at the small historical town of Jamestown. For a little while longer than 200 years, many people believed that the Jamestown fort got dragged away by a very large stream. Some searches in the area lead to the beleif that the fort might still be around.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jamestown fort was built in 1607 after the new, early settlers came from England. Many people believe that the Jamestown Fort was constructed on a river bank, as it was easier to access the water and fort. Some however debate that the fort was further inland due to objects found near the digging site. Being further away from the river would be a better spot because it allowed more protection to the sellers from enemy ships. James fort is not the only dig site that archaeologist search at they search at many different places all over the planet from Egypt to Ferry Farm where Gorge Washington lived.

Also Georges father, Augustine Washington moved his family to a place called Ferry Farm when George was only six years old. Then no one knew where George Washington and his family lived.The archeologists wanted to know about Georges life. Next,the archeologists gathered a team and the teams were of 35 people. One of the teams were using 3D computers to find out what was underground. The other group was focusing on the digging .They would be&nbsp; digging with shovels called skim they were so small ,flat, and sharp.The archeologists would also use trowling tools wich are&nbsp; small paint brushes ,small shovels ,and wooden picks. It would take them up to two weeks to dig a 25-square foot section! One of the other teams were working in labs trying to figure out what was undergroud.The whole project took forever but it was actualy worth it . This discovery of George Washingtons house really was important for persons because they get a better&nbsp; understanding of who George Washington was before he became famouse and our President.</p>	1		20131021113238	555	1		20131021134134	927	1		20131022130458	533	1

Archeologist finds those stuff there because they dig there and build new things like restaurants houses apartments or other different kind of stuff.Some times the rocks go under the dirt and some people take it out because they think its fun to do that but it is actually not because then you get yourself dirty.When people remove out the dirt they have to use the wheelbarrow.The archeologist</p> <p>tools are called pick shovel whisk dustpan knife wheelbarrow skim shovel and the trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,the archeologist could have a break and they could sleep but first you have to take a shower cause then the blankets could get dirty.Archeologist re very nice because they build stuff that we need like if we need a restaurant they will build one but we don't have to tell them what to do that will put it right away because they know something has to be there so then they will&nbsp; build it and then hey will have to use the wheelbarrow o they could take out the dirt and put it aide and they will be able to build it.Then when they are building it people will go to the restaurant and eat and they will enjoy there food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist are very hard workers&nbsp; and some people when they grow up they might want to be an archeologist.They will like it because they build new things for us.Some people like seeing the archeologist work because I think they like how they are building it.Some people walk threw there when they are building a restaurant and then they look at them and see how they drive the cars.Some time when the kids grow up they are going to like there job.</p>	1		20131021214854	509	1		20131022160007	533	1		20131025100100	516	1

They were trying to find the secrets of James Fort in Jamestown Virginia. Over 200 years people thought that the fort was washed away by a river</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The fort was built in 1607 when the settlers came from there home town of England for a new life. They thought that Jamestown was by a river so it would be easier to dock ships. They found objects nearby suggesting that the fort was farther away. It was probably for protection from enemy ships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first object they found were in 1861. Archeologists found armor and weapons.&nbsp; they also discover floors of buildings. 100 years later they were trying to find the exact spot were the fort was built. The National park service led 5 years of studying the area to figure out how they used the land. The people used computer mapping software to make the image of the area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Then they found James Fort. The first thing they found were a set of marks on the ground. They made maps and found out that reached all the way to a river. The ledges were soposed to hold canons. The archeologists found eleven cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten huge buildings all within the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Today the find almost 1 million objects a year. The objects are pottery, tools,coins,and even metal toys for the kids. In 1600's people throw their trash down an unused well or pit. While digging in the area the archaeologists found trash that the settlers threw away including bones of animals that they ate. They uderstand how the people at the fort lived. They know how they fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them. also how they survived the difficult years when they had little food.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	N		20131021111125	547		N	20131021174432	695		N

James Fort was made near a river so when ships came in it would be easier to take supplie to and from the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington was the first president of the united states. A long time ago George lived on something called a ferry farm. Ferry farms have been around for 12,000 years. Long time right, and still they dug up the base of George Washingtons house.

When people think of archeologists, they think of history. But there's a lot more to archeology than history. There's math, science, and manual labor. So be grateful that not only do we have archeology, but also that we have todays modern technology, because without it, we wouldn't have computers, archeology, science, or anything else.</p> <p>Archeologists have found some famous places like the house of George Washington and the James Fort. They have found lots of artifacts, like George Washnigton's clay pipe, broken pottery, even trash from what people ate! Now I think what would really surprise you is that some stuff that archeologists are hundreds of years old! So archeologists have to be really careful with their artifacts because they are very fragile.</p> <p>I would like to be an archeologist when I grow up so I can find famous artifacts too! So I sugest that if you want to be a archeologist that you shoul get good grades. If you want to learn more archeology, surf the web and you should see lots about archeology! And that's is my report on archeology and archeologists hopefully you'll be an archeologist when you grow up too!</p>	2		20131022115259	223	2		20131022135855	542	2

You may ask way is it hard,well your in luck because I will tell you all about a archeologists. First, you have to have a subject about what you are going to find that has not yet be found. Then you and your team have to set out to were it is located. You start searching to fine objects and dig. You study the objects and then try to relate them to anything that has to do with the subject. And you keep finding instring things. It takes along time to find and dig and study the objects. Sometimes it takes five years to study the area to know how the people back then used it.And you keep doing the samething.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then you find it! All that hard works pays off. First you find this object then that object,it is pretty hard to be a archeologists,but it is worth all the time and efort to spend on something like that because it is history,and that is how hard it is to be a archeologists.</p>	1		20131022114507	542	1		20131022134559	927	1

They have to be extremely careful with ancient relics. Archeologist also use special&nbsp; tools to use with delicate objects. They use the Whisk and Dustpan for things of that sort. The Knife is not what you might think it used for instead of a weapon its a tool to scrap off the dirt on artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now on to the more non-delicate tools. The Pick and Shovel are the tools that start the diging in the site. What ever you get out of the site from the pick and shovel the Wheelbarrow&nbsp; will come to hand. The Wheelbarrow will help carry dirt and stone to the surface. The skim shovel is use to carefuly take out thin layers of soil. the Trowel is the most common tool of archeology. It is use to srape and cut layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; With the tools I told you about they have dicoved many things about the world's past whitch i will tell you about. First, They found the fort of the island of death,Jamestown. The fort being 406 years old the archeologist have discovred many things. When finding the fort they found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites, told you the island of death, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort. when digging they found bone of animals that the settlers ate and metal toys. then the archeologists found the items the need to so the went on to an other adventure to the wasington residents.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding Washington's house was an fantisic find. the frist things they found was the kitchen, slave quarters,&nbsp; and the storage houses. Years later they found the main Farmhouse. they had to make sure it was George Washington's farm house because there were other people were he lived. finding a clay pipe&nbsp; gave proof that this is his house because he smoked clay pipes. The archeologist kept digin for mounths and are still finding George Whashington's past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats what I learned on histrey day.</p>	1		20131022130526	535		N	20131022140828	542	1		20131023133943	560	1

Another thing archeologists found where George Washington lived as a kid. It took them forever buy they never gave up. the first thing they found was the kitchen and then the rest of the house. One thing that helps archeologists is their tools. They use many tools like a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and a trowel.

Archeologist have to be very careful with artifacts they find because some of the artifacts can be 100's of years old and could be very fragile,or breakable. Archeologist also dig up very big things such as when they digged up the stone base on which they believed was George Washington's home when he was young. Archeologist also use many tools such as the whisk and dustpan which they use to wipe off dirt or dust on a artifact. they would also use a wheelbarrow to carry loads of something, like dirt.</p> <p>&nbsp; As you can see Archeologist have a pretty cool job, and important job.

My name is Dilyn an I'm going to tell you about the job of an archeologist.</p> <p>Archeologist have a special job. What they do can be difficult they dig up they past. In order to do this job you must always be focused. They have to be focused because if they're not they might miss what they're looking for.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist have to study hard to know what they're looking for. If they are looking for</p> <p>Fort James, they have to do lot of research in order to find it. Find out what it looked like the state or city it was in things like that. This is not a one man job you need some help from other archeologists. it will probably take more than&nbsp; day maybe a couple months so be prepared.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have a pretty special job you just have to know what your doing.</p> <p>I'm not that focused but the archeologists are. The research they do help hem find thing and help other people.</p> <p>If someone asked an archeologist to find something they do research and they go and find it. Or if they want to find something they do the same.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist special to their team and other people. I can never stay focused so i cant be an archeologist but maybe you can be one some day. And i hope if you do you have u and be focused and prepared.</p>	1		20131021082706	551	1		20131021092739	546	1		20131021160557	560	1

If you are a lucky archeologist you may find interesting items. For example Colubus's map when he landed in America, or a piece of Indian pottery.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes, the really hardwork pays off when something interseting you find goes into a musiem and people can learn from the artifacts you dug up from the dirt.&nbsp; If you find something like Leonardo da Vinci's plans for a submarine it could benifit mankind for years to come.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The job of an archeologist can be interseting and hardworking, but just like any other job it pays off with education and money too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022130400	554	1		20131022141635	696	1

Archeologists find these things so we can know what was going on in the earth before life or humans or even i was born. they give us information so we know what to look out for and know what is going on in the world we live in now.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people can grow up to be an Archeologist but they need the right supplies to dig. They cant just use a shovel they also need a pic and a shovel of course to dig into the ground and and pic is to soften up the ground or break roots, and they need whisk and dustpan to clean of the artifacts they find, and a knife to carefully dig and scrape dirt from around the artifact, and a wheelbarrow to take things from one place to another, and two more things you need is a kim shovel and a trowel the kim shovel. The trowel is probable the most common tool in archeology. it is used ton scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now i told you the supplies you need and what archeologists do there are archeologists all over the world and they are very good at what they do. Someday&nbsp; archeologists are going to find out that flying monkeys and pigs were living thousands of years ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022114621	547	1		20131022135233	695	1

I never did, but when I read about it I thought it was very interesting, and I bet you would think that to.First, lets talk about what are archeologist. Archeologist are people who travel around the world and look for unknown artifacts.When archeologist find something, it can change the past, or tell us more about history. For example, some archeologist found objects where George Washington's(our first general, and president of the United States) family lived. They taught us more about George Washington's past, and found many stuff that George Washington, him self, held. Another example, is about finding Fort James. Unlike the George Washington's story, Fort James actually toke longer. Soon many Archeologist found many valuable things at Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There are many types of tools you would need to be an archeologist. I'm going to tell you what the tools are by saying them in a list that will show the 6 common tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br><u><b>Pick and shovel</b></u> <br><u><b>Whisk and Dustpan</b></u> <br><u><b>Knife</b></u> <br><u><b>Wheelbarrow</b></u> <br><u><b>Skim Shovel</b></u> <br><b><u>&nbsp;Towel</u><u>&nbsp;</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Pick and Shovel are usually the most common</p> <p>thing anyone can use. If you were an archeologist, you would use</p> <p>these first if you found a spot to dig. these two tools dig into the earth to find the artifacts. If you get lucky and find an object, you'll notice that it's all dirty and dusty. This is where the whisk and dustpan come to the rescue. They are used to brush the artifact and clean away the sand and dirt. A knife isn't that important, so I'm not going to say a lot about it. The knife is only used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifact. If you have al lot of stuff, then a wheelbarrow is the perfect thing. A wheelbarrow is used for carrying stuff and taking the left over dirt to a different location. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove thin layers of soil with each scoop. Although, I said a pick and shovel are the most common thing, its actually the trowel which is the most common tool. it's used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Now that I told you everything I could, I hope you will want learn more about being an archeologist &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022131441	927	2		20131022140954	551	1		20131023130519	533	1

Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. The discovery of Washington's home is important for many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George was before he became famous. We also began to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.&nbsp; Most of what we know about George Washington comes from his time as a soilder and president. Biographies don't have very much information about his childhood. Thats changing however,discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021132008	547	2		20131021140140	546	2

Also you have to work hard to find things. Like when they where finding George Washington's it took a long time to find something. Also when trying to find fort James it took a long time from finding the first artifact to finding the real thing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the right tool for the job is important because if you're digging something up you and you use a trowel then it's going to take a long time the using a shovel. Also if you're trying to find something but you run into stone then it's harder to break when using a kinfe then a pickaxe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; So being an archeologistis hard. there are a lot of thing you need to do.

Like for example Fort James when a team would find any objects an archeologist would study the item to figure out the lifestyle back then. It is fun to learn about our ancestors that lived long ago. It tells us about a piece of our past about people who lived long ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they first found fort James they found marks where the walls used to be an archeologist would study the marks to learn more about fort James. With the archeologists hard work they figured out the building was shaped like a triangle. Archeologists also found stone ledges over the river to hold canons. The archeologists found many more things at fort James like cellars and buildings.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the archeologist group finds about 1 million objects every year. They find things like pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys. While digging they found where they threw their garbage including bones from a animal that they ate. thanks to archeologists we know how the people in fort James lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of what we know about George Washington's childhood comes from archeologists. They found out that in Georges childhood he lived on the land known as the Ferry Farm George was only six when they moved their.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time know one knew exactly where Georges house really was. But archeologists believed that the houses stone base was stile there underground. They started to dig in 2003 and found it in about 2004. The first buildings they found was the kitchens, slave quarters, and storage houses. They also found the main farm house a few years later.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their were more than one house on the Ferry Farm at the time so they had to find proof that this was George Washington's house. They looked at records of George Washingtons past. They found that he had a fire in his house so they searched for burnt items. they found burnt pottery. They also found part of a clay pipe and records show that George smoked clay pipes. This discovery gives us proof that George Washington did live there.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all these discoveries weren't made we wouldn't know as much about the past as we know today.

An archeologist can discover things you never even knew existed. The first artifacts to be discovered&nbsp; by an Archeologists were found in 1861. Those artifacts were armor and weapons from a fort called &quot;Fort James&quot; which was built in 1607.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So far, I learned that archeology groups discover up to 1 million artifacts each year.</p> <p>In source #3, I found some of the tools that Archeologists use. For example, they used a trowel in &quot;Digging up George Washington's Past&quot;. A trowel is a tool Archeologists used to scrape and cut to see the diverse layers of soil. Archeologists used trowels in their study of the discovering the past of George Washington. Which was an interesting discovery, in my opinion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, do you think you understand the job of an Archeologist?</p> <p>If not as a reminder,an Archeologist is someone who discovers things from the early days. In my opinion, archeologists are pretty cool. Aside from finding dinosaur fossils, archeologist can discover cooler things like past president childhoods. I hope you enjoyed the report on the job of an archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021095614	927	2		20131021191743	551	2

They uncover things from our past and are a big part of finding out more about history. They have helped us learn about the Jamestown Colony and George Washington's life. Here are some examples of what archeologists do.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists go to areas such as the location of Jamestown to find information about the colony. Such as in Source #1, archeologists must first predict where James Fort was located to find proof it still exsisted. Once they used the appropriate software, they eventually found the fort and set off to work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They learned the fort stretched to the river, found burial sites, cellars, and a few buildings, and also found objects the colony used. Archeologists discovered things such as pottery, tools, and metal toys for the childen. Archeologists found out that colonists threw their trash in a well or pit; they found things such as bones of animals they had eaten. They found many discoveries in the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example of how archeologists are important is the discovery of where George Washington lived. As it says in Source #2,it took over a year to find proof of where he lived. Archeologists found the kitchen, slave quarters, storage houses, and eventually the main farmhouse. There was one problem though, about 4 other houses were on Ferry Farm land and the archeologists needed proof that this was Washington's farmhouse. It was said there had been a fire in the house, so archeologists looked in the farmhouse and found part of a clay pipe. Archeologists knew that Washington smoked clay pipes, so they knew had more proof this was the right house.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are 2 reasons archeologists are important, they discover many things are past and find locations for them to study and find more information about. They help us learn about the past and they deserve a thumbs up.</p>	1		20131021093051	555	2		20131021135538	516	2		20131021222056	509	1

While they are looking for things they have to use diffrent tools like the pick,shovel, whisk,dustpan.knife.wheelbarrow,skim shovel,and the trowel. One of the artifacts found by archeolagists is a plate that is thought to be from his house.artifacts are inportant cause without them it would be harder to know what life was like back then.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion Ithink that an archolagists job is hard cause it takes so much time just to dig up a little bit of land. In one of the paragraphs it states that it takes two weeks just to dig up twenty-five feet of land. Wow!archeolagist are an inportant part of helping history uncover.archeolagist are smart ,and hard working people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever wonder why archeolagist discover things?They do this cause it helps uncover facts about the pastarcheolagist are important in our schools cause they are some of the reasons we have the information in our books.

Another tool they use is whisk and dustpan, which they use to brush dirt off the artifact and to clear away dirt from the excavation site. The other tools are knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel and trowel. All those tools have one very important job, they have to carefully clean the dirt off the artifacts with out damaging them.

Well, those movies are about a college professor who also happens to be an archeologist. He goes on crazy missions looking for lost riches. But no, an archeologist is not someone who goes to exotic places and find secret rooms and burial chambers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The definition of an archeologist a scientist who studies the past. It's kind of like a historian, except historians read the books about life in the past. As for archeologists, they are there to get dirty. All they want is information about the past. And, to make a difference, people don't sit down. No sir, they get up and make a difference. They do travel to interesting places, but not to relax. Oh no, they are there to discover the past, comparing life now and then.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the things they want to figure out is how people lived back in time, what were some of the daily materials and items they used, their techniques for building, farming, cooking, and other stuff like that. The first step in archeology is not to know who the people they are studying are, but where they lived. For example, the archeologists who wanted to study Jamestown, thought that the area where the colonists from Jamestown lived, had been washed away by a river. But that rumor didn't stop them from investigating. Only a true archeologist would prove it to themselves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And lucky they decided to prove it to themselves, or archeologists wouldn't have found all the amazing artifacts in the area where people believed Jamestown had once stood. Some of the things they&nbsp; dug out of the ground include uncovered armor, weapons, floors of buildings, eleven cellars, tons of burial grounds, ten crumbled buildings, pottery, tools, coins, and even metal toys for children! As for George Washington's land where he lived, it did take some time to do, but they did find the Washington's land. They found the kitchen, slave quarters, storage houses, and later on the main farmhouse. Archeologists also have to do research, like when they needed to know if the buildings they found on Washingtons land was their house. So, they found records that showed that the Washingtons had a fire in the house, which mached the burnt pottery they found, and that was proof enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologists have to use may different tools to do their job, like a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarow, skim shovel and trowels. It is a slow process, and you must have patience, but in the end of a discovery, you are a hero to be an american, by knowing so much about our countries past. And that, my friend, is the life of a true archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021190544	559	2		20131022104707	925	2		20131022113743	533	2

Archeologists are people who study objects they have found from the past. Archeologists use a series of tools, such as a pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. I hope you enjoy learning all about archeologists!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists don't only study anchent artifacts, they search for them, too. It takes a pick to dig past stone, it takes a shovel to dig past dirt, it takes a seires of tools just to find one artifact. It could take them 25 weeks to find an artifact. The most common tool used is a trowel. Anchent artifacts could be like Washington's house, or dinosaur bones.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an archeologist can be hard work, because more than half the time they have to study. They rarely get to dig for things. If you want to find something cool underground, bring a metal detector to the beach, you're sure to find something there! That would make being an archeologist a little harder, considering they don't use metal detectors.This is what I learned about arceologists.</p>	1		20131021192958	563	1		20131022093703	547	1

He or she gets the artifacts and studies them for a long time until they know everything about them.Once they know everything about them, they put them away in a safe place. Then, over the years, more and more archeologist's know more about them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an archeologist finds something interesting and they like it, they try to learn as much as they can about it. They search it up and ask other archeologist labs about it. They also work with other archeologists to see if they know anything about it. The others also bring something and share it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, many others get to see the wonderful things they have in the lab.

One for instance, is that they find and study what hasn't been discovered. Another reason is because they can teach us more and maybe in the future we can take that evidence and some how connect it to others and find out what the big secret was. The last reason I think that archeologists are important is because they are our number one fact source.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; With the exception of, the first reason why I state that archeologists are important is because they will or might work on something that we do not know where it is and is a mystery. The reason archeologists do that is to have a clearer image in their head and also because they might be curious about the evidence that leads to the conclusion. Also archeologists figure out if something is true or not.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to, the second reason that I think that archeologists are very important is because they can help us connect to new evidence by old evidence. That is true because if they have a hard time with some mystery then they usually find other mysteries and somehow connect them. That helps archeologists because they might solve both mysteries in just one problem and figure out what was the main purpose.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last reason that I think archeologists are important is because they are our number one fact source. Without archeologists we would have fight about everything on social studies because the evidence is always switching around. Also, if there weren't no archeologists to solve the mystery it will always remain that way. Also archeologists find rare items that we might see in drawings or a famous person might talk about.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I state that archeologists are really important because they solve our mysteries and leave us blank. They study things and come up with answers to solve our problems tell us more about a specific subject. And that is how archeologists are really important to this world.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021140505	554	2		20131021192410	546	2		20131021222812	509	2

Recently archeologists found out where Fort James lies. This must have been a great discovery for them! Archeologists found out most of our history. I think that it is great that we them in our world.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Im sure that arceologistis love there jobs they get a first class look at all the cool history that we dont get to see until they put it in the musem.With out arceologistis we would not know about all the stuff that happened with George Washington and and all the other stuff that arceologistis have discoved in the past. &nbsp;

They use special tools that can help them dig up the treasures berried within the surface of the earth. They use 3D computers to help them find out what is underneath. When they find something they start to dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind of tools they use are very interesting. One of the tools they use re the knife. The knife is for when they find something that is small but has something sticking to it they use it to scrape or separate the two objects. Also they use a skim shovel to take out little amounts of dirt at a time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole thing overall is a slow process but it is worth the wait.

It also takes a lot of tools like a wheelbarrow,knife,pick,shovel,whisk,dustpan,skim shovel,trowel,etc. so it it will also cost a lot of money to do the project and to pay the workers. But in the end it is very interesting to see what you found you pay for everybody because it goes into history and everybody knows more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see how hard the job of an archeologist might be but you can also see how interesting it also might be.

Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you a little bit about working as an archeologist. First things first. What is an archeologist?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist is a person who tries to find artifacts that famous people from the past, like George Washington, used. Then, they study the artifacts to find more information about that person and their life as a child. Archeologists don't work by themselves, they work in groups.These groups are called teams. There are many teams working on one site and can be up to 35 people on a team. Each team works on something different. One team uses 3D computers that can track things underground to map out the area. This way, people know where to start digging. The second group does the actual digging. They use special tools to help them. For example, the skim shovel is a small, flat, sharp shovel which they use to remove thin layers of soil. After, the soil is put in a box with a screen at the bottom so the soil will fall through and the artifacts will stay in. The last team studies the artifacts in a lab for days. It takes a long time to complete the process of digging and studing the objects but helps us understand more about well-known people!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, a job as an archeologist would be tiring but you would also find some cool artifacts from history and learn more about famous people from the past!</p>	2		20131022131352	563	2		20131022135937	695	2		20131024074833	509	2

For example: A pick is a tool used for digging. You could even use a tool called a whisk. A whisk is like a small brome.there is also somthing called a trowel. A trowel is a common tool they use . It is like a shovel but smaller. The last tool you might not know is called a skim shovel. It is used to scoop out little layers of dirt. Some tools you may know is the shovel, dust pan, knife and the wheelbarrow.</p> <p>There is two main jobs they can do.......</p> <p>1. they can go out and dig up history, find ancient artifacts and use cool tools!</p> <p>2. they can stay in the lab and find out more about the artifacts they find outside underground.</p> <p>they can do many things that will help use under stand our past.</p>	1		20131021144051	925	1		20131021182726	542	1

If so you might want to consider a job as an archeologist. This job presents an opportunity to learn all sorts of things about famous people who came before you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist's job is very important. They devote their time to finding out more about the lives and families of famous people that we don't know much about. For example, we knew little about where Gorge Washington grew up, until archeologists excavated the Ferry Farm site. While we knew much about his time as a soldier and president, as well as his life at his family home at Mount Vernon archeologists made it possible to know what he experienced as a child. this is important because his child life influenced many of the important decisions he made.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is the dig site at Fort James. a lot of people thought that it was swept away by the river, but recent discoveries suggest otherwise. A group of devoted archeologists spent many weeks excavating a huge amount of land that led to recent discoveries at the site of Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While many people thought that the inner buildings of the fort were close to the river, so it would be easier to dock ships archeologists have discovered that they were located further away for protection from enemy ships. they have also discovered what remains of a stone wall that would have held cannons to ward off intruders.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These discoveries have made it possible to learn many things about the Fort and the people who lived in it. They couldn't have done it without their tools, though. To give you a better idea of what the archeologists would have used to ,make these important discoveries here is a run down of the tools for you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would start with a skim shovel to take off the thin levels of to soil, and to locate the artifacts that were left close to the surface. Then they would use regular shovels to pick up dirt to drop into a half inch screen, that let the dirt fall out, but left the artifacts in. Next they would load the dirt into a wheelbarrow to be moved to a different site to be examined for any small artifacts that slipped through holes in the screen.&nbsp; someone will then bring the artifacts to a lab where groups of scientists will spend weeks looking over them, and figuring out what they mean. They then use trowels to cut soil samples to be examined by soil scientists. There are many other tools, but these are the main ones. They have to be so careful digging that it can take over two weeks to clear a twenty-five foot section!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you know about the many trials and rewards that make up the job of an archeologist, think about it. We should really be thankful that there are people out there that are devoted enough to take time away from their families to make the important discoveries that they do. Do you think that you have the diligence to become one?</p>	2		20131021091921	554	2		20131021105017	223	2

The life of an archeologist is hard and interesting too! Long hours, lots of digging and searching for where these places are.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes more than a year or two to find the place, such as Fort James. They had to dig underground to find where it was! Usually, it is totally worth it. Finding new things about different people and places. Like their childhood, history, lives, learn how they became famous, what decisions they made, what type of life they had, and much, much more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of there projects was Finding Fort James. For more than 200 years, everyone thought that it had been washed away by some river near by. Some say, there are some discoveries in the area said it might still be around. The fort was built in 1607. That was when English settlers came to start a new life. The first objects that were found was in 1861. They uncovered armor and weapons. Then, they found what they were looking for.......the floors of the buildings. Over about 100 years later, a group was trying to find the exact spot where the fort was first built and where it began!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Park Service helped construct a five year study of the area to find how all of the land was used and what could be built on it. They did this because they wanted proof that the fort was still here. People who helped with the study used special computer mapping software to make images of the area, maybe sort of like an X-ray. They finally found it! They found cellars to burial sites to buildings and much, much, more! Today, the group has found and dug up more than 1 million objects each year! They found pottery, tools, coins, and metal toys for kids!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the other projects they did was the past on Ferry Farm. Ferry Farm has been known for over 12,000 years. People have lived on Ferry Farm but do you know the most famous person that lived there?&nbsp; Well, it was George Washington himself. He moved there with his family when he was six years old. No one knows exactly where they lived because the house is long gone. Archeologists think it is still there. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year , but of course they found it. They first found kitchens, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then, they finally found the main farmhouse a couple years later.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were at least four other houses that were built on that land, so they needed to find the proof that this was George Washington's House for sure. The records showed that they had a fire in that house. What did they find? Burnt pottery! They also found a part of a clay pipe! Washington smoked clay pipes. After that, they knew that this was their house and there was a fire in the house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you think the archeologists find this stuff in Washington's house? Well, it was a careful one. you could tell they were a pretty rich family from all the pottery and expensive stuff. They had several groups. The groups consists of 35 people at least on every team. One team maps the area using 3D computers that tracks what is underground. This is helpful so that the diggers know where to dig for the object and what it looks like.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another team does the digging part. They are called the dig. They use a lot of tools. Let me describe them for you.</p>  <br>Pick and Shovel-Most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. <br>Whisk and Dustpan-Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. <br>Knife-Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. <br>Wheelbarrow-Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. <br>Skim Shovel-A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. <br>Trowel-Probable the most common tool in archeology. Used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. <br>Citation: Information from passage Tools Used by Archeologists  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This helps us learn about our founding fathers and just pain old famous people and things. These are all part of Americas Past. We learn more about our history as a nation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I would like and not like to be an archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br>Yes-I would like to because it would be fun to learn about our past and how it came to be the United States of America. To learn more about the people who helped the America be America, to be one Union not two. It would help to teach and learn more about our past, America's Past. <br>No-I wouldn't like to be an archeologist because I can't stand to be somewhere at one time the whole time I need to move around. I like to be active and have that would be fun but it is too long to be there everday. It would also be a huge commitment, long hours, lots of digging, and searching. I guess just too much for me.  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that an archeologists work is hard work, lots of digging, long hours, and searching too. All hard work but still it is fun and usually worth it! You find amazing things to learn about. Childhoods, family members, how wealthy they were, where they lived, history and much, much more. You will also find more artifacts, life, and history than you would in a book! Everything you find tells a story a house, pottery, clay pipes, are all artifacts that will tell a story about that person or place. It is an amazing job to have! You can also see more artifacts in museums because most artifacts are in cultural museums or history museums. You can find them anywhere!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131025091930	77	2		20131025092430	509	2

An archeologiest is a person who's job is an archeology. When you are an archologiest you try to find objects in the ground and see what they mean and what they are. There are teams in archology, each team has at least 35 people in it. One group you have to walk around with a detecer and try to find metal objects and other objects underground. An other group digs down in the ground and that team is called &quot;A Dig&quot;. And the last group stays in the lab and cleans the objects off. It takes at least 2 weeks to make a 25square foot hole. When some archeoloiests found James Fort and they found 1 million objects a year. When they dig they dif with a small shovel and it digs a layer of sand they are very sharp. And thats Archeology.</p>	1		20131021093720	563	1		20131021105557	555	2		20131021215907	509	1

An <b><b>archeologist </b></b>has many tools to help on finding the artifacts. Some tools include pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. These tools help an archeologist to find a special artifact and each one has a job of its own. An archeologist is a person who study's the past while finding evidence and artifacts from history. How does an archeologist does all of this work in the sun and still do the work nice and carefully? An archeologist is a person who loves to study the past and would do ANYTHING to discover something new story(from the history of course). An archeologist travels to different places and to new different things and study's about them. Any place that has history to search has an archeologist. An archeologist has a exciting, dirty, and fun job. They have an exclusive job at what they do. I would really like to be an archeologist someday because an archeologist has a job very <b><b>important</b></b> to the history.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Days Of Work</u></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything an archeologist does, takes about 2 weeks straight without stopping! How fun is it to stay out in the sun and do work?&nbsp; Not really! But to an archeologist, it is! Many archeologist study's Native Americans and how they lived then. Some archeologist study's people who was famous and died. Then, there is more archeologists who study's more than 1,000 years ago!!! An archeologist has a job that most smart kids wish they were them. Studying the past covers things like a misunderstanding of the past. So if whom shall say that a captain sunk his ship and hit a hard rock because he <b><b>misread</b></b> his compass just to get home to his gal Jesse Bell and marry her, but instead some one took an iron nail and put it in the back of the compass to be able for someone to misread it. So an archeologist study's all of those things just to clear up the past which some people is <b><b>perplexed</b></b> about.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u>Days of&nbsp; Work</u></p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A job of an archeologist is finding artifacts about the history and proving his/her point. In the article of <b><u>Digging Up George Washington's History </u></b>, they have to find the spot that they will find the artifacts and they start digging. They have to make sure that the spot is the correct spot to dig up the <b><b>artifacts</b></b> or they will get everything in a mixed up order and won't get the information that they need. So when the archeologist finds the right place and then they start getting their group of people and they start digging . That is why the job of an archeologist is very important to the history. See, an archeologist finds the artifacts for a reason not just for fun.&nbsp; They do it for a&nbsp; cause of the history's misunderstandings or a new story in the history. Like, <b><u>Finding Fort James,</u></b><u> </u>They do the <b><b>research</b></b> and they have to be interested in finding the fort James not just they because they do it for money.</p> <p>~ <b>Tiffany Dang</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b><u>Vocabulary</u></b></p> <p>Perplexed- it means to be really confused about something</p> <p>Archeologist- Someone who digs up facts from the past</p> <p>Artifacts- Any evidence to prove to an archeologist that it is the real thing from the past</p> <p>Research- To find information about something</p> <p>Misread- something that is not been read clearly or read too fast to read clearly understand it.</p> <p>Important- Something <b><b>Special</b></b> to something or someone</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022130252	925	2		20131022142113	555	2		20131024075641	509	2

Another way is they might find books and magazines to say what they say then studies what they found and what the magazines and books said.

Today I</p> <p>going to tell you how an archeologist work or study. First I only know somethings about archeologist.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy and learn some facts and their main job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Did you ever wanted to be a archeologist? Well you have to know the basics to able to be an archeolo-</p> <p>gist. One thing archeologist does is first they learn what their guy or women their learning about like Leonardo da Vinci or George Washington and so on so. You can even learned about dinosaurs but that will be called a Meteorologist. After you learned whoever you learned for a while you have to figure what artifacts that were buried for ages, years, decades, or century's.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you study about that thing or person you to go to the internet to search to know what artifacts are buried. If you look at source 1 it will tell you how the group of people finding the secrets of Fort James, meaning it tells you how they found the artifacts. If you keep studying you will probably be ready for the next step of being an archeologist. If you are ready for the next step it is about location where to dig and getting the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Looking for the artifacts is a bit hard because you need some people to help you dig the artifacts. If you</p> <p>look in the source 3 it will tell you how to dig, teaching you what materials or things to use to help you dig the artifacts or unburied the artifacts. These materials are picks and shovels, whisk, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrows, and others. After you found your artifacts you have to be careful and use a toothpick to take off the dirt in or on the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Congratulation if you find a artifact, and if you didn't still congratulation it takes years to master to be</p> <p>an archeologist. I hope you learned somethings about a job of an archeologist. I hope who ever reads this has hopes of being an archeologist and if they do I wish you good luck in your future. Thank You!!</p>	2		20131021151646	535	2		20131021182346	542	2

From people like Egypt's dead Pharohs or Black Beard. Archeologists use lots of tools to find different things and artifacts, but in the passage it says that the most common tool is the trowel. It is used to scrape and cut, to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists give people the gift of a better understanding more things from more people. They also give us the understanding of why people made these choices.

Argeologist is very interesting because you can find something the world doesn't know. They use many tools to do this job. In this report there are details about finding Fort James and digging up George Washington's past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1964, many people wanted to find Fort James in Virginia. Some people thought it was washed away by a river. The fort was built by a England settler in 1607. THe first object found was uncovered armor in 1861. The people who study for Fort James used a computer mapping softwar to make a image of the area. Finaly they found it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people know George Washington when he was the&nbsp; president and as a soldier. Many people wanted to know about George Washington's past. Argeologist found out that George Washington's father moved his family to Ferry Farm. George was six years old at the time. No one knew exactly where George's house was. Archeologist believed that they could find. They started digging in 2003. The next year they found it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time arceologists use a pickaxe and a shovel to dig down. They also used a wheelbarrow to move items to carry dirt to excavation.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes time for an arceologist to find something, but if they work together they can succeed. They used many objects and elctronics to find Fort James and digging up George's past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022132257	550	2		20131022133849	223	2

The life of an archologist is hard, there is alot of hard work and detication. If you wnat to be an archeologist you would need to know alot about history to know what you want to find.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists need to study <b>hard</b>. When you dig up holes in the ground you need to be strong and healthy, beacause if you are not strong and healthy you wont be able to dig at least a 25-foot hole. Eating healthy and working out is a good way to say in shape for the life of an archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you dig up hole you will find all sorts of different things like gold, diamonds, treasure, and many other different things, but first you have to us a 3D computers that track what is udergroud and what you want to find. Then you start the hard work, digging&nbsp; to dig you need special tools like a pick axe, a shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. When you find the place you want to dig acheologists call it the &quot;dig&quot;. The whole dig can take up to two weeks. After you find everything that seems interesting things that you found you take it to the lab where another team studies it and try to find the history about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find the life of an archeologist intersting then I think you should try&nbsp; it, and remember the life of an archeologist can be exciting!</p>	2		20131022130218	555	2		20131022205343	554	2

Well, I do so I'm going to talk about everything they do. Archeologists are people who help us discover about the past and how people in colonial America lived. Archeologists find all this information by digging in places where former presidents have lived etc. What is exactly an archeologists? Archeologists are people who spend time digging and finding old pottery, armor, weapons, tools they used to make things. Archeologists, for me are very important people because they give us a chance of seeing are world's history and culture. Being an archeologist is very painful but it is worth it because you have to spend a lot of time digging and digging until you finally find something. Then you have to clean it until all the dirt is off, if the artifact is broken you have to spend time gluing the pieces down.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, an archeologist gigs up the artifacts and when they find the artifact they have to clean it with a tool called a whisk. You have to be a patient person to be an archeologist because it can take years to find one thing. If you are not a patient person you would want to get a different job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to list all of the tools an archeologist uses to do their job, archeologists use a pick and a shovel, a whisk and a dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. The pick and shovel are used to dig into the Earth, close to the artifacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the exavation site. The knife is used fo careful digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt from the excavation site. The skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology, it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were to be an archeologist i would like to find artifacts of King Tut because long, long, long time ago he once rulled Egypt and back then in Egypt kings were not called kings they were called Pharoes. I would to find all his jewery, his crown from when he was pharoh, pottery that he made, and some clothing that he wore.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think people would like to be interested in being an archeologist because you will have the chance to dig up the life of a well-known person or you could find some things of what they made.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the job of an archeologist is exciting and not exciting at the same time. I think that it is exciting because you get to dig up the past and be one of the first ones to see the artifact. I think it is not exciting because sometimes you end up with nothing and you are digging in the hot sun you you get tired really fast.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just talked about the job of an archeologist and how they work, but I also added my opinion about archeology. Archeologists are very important people because they dig up artifacts that no one has ever seen in their entire life. For example: people dug up artifacts of George Washington and some archeologists found some artifacts of James Fort.</p>	2		20131021154603	223	2		20131022132731	555	2

What exactly is an archeologist? Well an archeologist is a person who spends there time in search of digging up artifacts from the past whether it is old pottery pieces, armor, weapons, tools, coins, or metal toys for children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't expect pottery from thousands of years ago to be in one whole piece, so if an archeologist is lucky enough to find all the pieces from pottery they most likely will spend their time gluing all the pieces together to discover more of what type of pottery people in the past made. Being an archeologist requires a lot of time and patience because you might not always find what you are looking for right away.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do archeologists find artifacts from the past? Well, each year many teams will work on a site where they're trying to find information. There can be up to 35 people on a team! One of the teams maps out the site using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The team that is digging can use the map that the 3D computers show so that they can know what it looks like underground before they start digging. The area the digging team does the digging is called a dig. The archeologists in this group start their dig by using Skim Shovels. That soil that they scoop up is then placed in a box with a half screen at the bottom. The half screen lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling which is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. Another team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts that were found. It takes a lot of people working together to discover our worlds past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use many tools to discover all these artifacts. As I mentioned earlier the group that does the digging uses a skim shovel. A skim shovel has a flat edge that is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soilwith each scoop. Another tool that the archeologists use is a pick and shovel which is a tool that most digs start with. The pick and shovel is used to dig into the earth, close to the objects. There are many tools that are used to brush away the dirt off of an artifact. One of those tools is a whisk and a dustpan. A whisk and a dustpan can also be used to clear away dirt from the excavation center. A knife also can be used to scrape away the dirt around an artifact. A knife can also be used for careful digging. A wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another, but can also be used like the whisk and dustpan to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The most common tool and archeologist uses is a trowel. A trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of the soil. Archeologists use many tools to make their job a whole lot easier and accurate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archeologists jobs are long, tiresome, and hard. It can take up to 2 weeks to dig a 25 square foot section. All those weeks add up when you are digging up a large space. It's definitely true that it takes time to actual dig up and discover the objects but to add on top of that, the time that it will take to study the objects, find out what they mean, and use other bits of information to tie in to the object that they had found. Archeologists must take their time and have patience to truly discover, enjoy, and appreciate what they have found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is important, meaningful, and exciting for us to discover about our worlds past, and it's hard to do that without any kind of proof. These artifacts that our archeologists find show us the objects that were regularly used by people many years ago. All the artifacts in museums had to be discovered one way or another and they were dug up by archeologists! These artifacts give us a piece of our past and ties us to the the people who lived back then. These artifacts give us a better understanding of the United States past. The job of an archeologist is super important! We get to learn why a certain person made a certain decision from the objects they left behind. Without archeologists we wouldn't know any of this information and would be clueless. I hope you now understand why an archeologist's job is so significant! What would we do without our archeologists?&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023204933	509	2		20131025090021	533	2

I'm going to tell you &nbsp; about good things and not so good things of being an Archeologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an Archeologist can be so much fun!! Archeologists can learn new things of humans that lived long ago. They use lots of tools to find artifacts to predict things that might happen that nobody didn't&nbsp; know about. An Archeologist found lots of things about George Washington's childhood such as burnt potteries, part of a clay pipe and other things. It would be so interesting to be an Archeologist because you can explore new things that occur in the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an Archeologist sometimes wont be easy. Archeologists might have so much stress and anxiety. Archeologists can hurt your self for putting so much pressure of finding things. Ssome of the tools they use wont be that much help because it can take a month to find just 3 things. If&nbsp; I had to choose one thing to not like of being an Archeologist is having stress of finding something.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;In conclusion, being an Archeologist is hard and fun at the same time. If you want to be an Archeologist follow your dreams don't let the bad things come in your way. For me i think its so fun and so interesting to learn about famous humans.</p>	1		20131021084117	926	1		20131021092952	547	1

An archeologist has to take their time working or they could mess up and ruin the fossils or the items they dig up it is not always fossils like they found part of George Washington past house. There a lot of steps an archeologist has to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; First thing an archeologist has to do is look for the fossil. They way they find the fossils is by looking into the history of what they are trying to find so when they find where the information is. Once they find that information of where they parts may be they start to track the area with a 3D computer that helps them see underground so the can look for the parts of a historical area or fossils. They record the information so they know how big or small, and how they part or fossils will look like before they they start digging. If the part or fossils is really big they will have more than one archeologists digging for it so it does not take a long time. The the part or fossils is very small there only needs to be one archeologist looking for it because it wont take a long time to dig it up. The archeologist has to be very careful and take their time digging or they might miss the part or hit it and break it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Once the archeologist know where the part or fossils is and know its size he/she will start digging. They have to use many materials to dig up the parts or fossils. They first material they will use is the skim shovels. The skim shovels are very small, flat, and sharp that they can only remove thin layers of soil one layer at a time. Once they remove all the soil with they skim shovels they put the soil in in a box that has an half-inch screen at the bottom, this screen allows the dirt to fall out while the artifacts stay in. They could also use another process of digging called troweling. Troweling is when the archeologists use small shoves, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove the dirt of the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Since the archaeologist have found they artifacts and the labs have studied they could put them on display at museums for everybody to look at. They could make a building where kids could dig up their own artifacts while the archeologists teach them how like they with they Ferry Farm. They could do many thing to get everybody involved&nbsp; in the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; In conclusion, they job of an archeologists is hard and takes a long time but when they find the artifact in the end it is all worth it. I think many people should get involved in digging up our history's past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022112858	927	2		20131022125714	546	2

Well archeologists do mostly history. Archeologists started in 1944. Archeologists have three jobs they track the items the miners are going to get, then they mine, and they study the objects the miners find.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the team of archeologists tracks down what the miners are looking for. They do this on a 3D computer. They keep it on what they are looking for so the miners get an idea where the item there looking for is. To conclude, this team of archeologists starts the work by showing the miners where the piece of american history is..</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, comes the second team of archeologists the miners. They do the mining by looking at the 3D computer to find out what they are searching and where it is. Then, they go looking for it and when they find it the just mine it out. They start mining by using a skim shovel. The skim shovels are small, flat, and sharp so they can remove the thin layers of soil one at a time. Then the archeologists use a process called trowling where they they will use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove the last layer of dirt. To conclude, these archeologists minewith different tools and find the american history pieces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Last, the third or last team comes in to see what the miners found. They study the objects and try to find out what the miners have found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. These type of miners must be patient for it's a long process.To conclude, these miners must have studied lots of hisory to find what the miners could have found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the three hardworking and tiresome archeologists job. To conclude, all teams of archeologists work really hard to discover new american history for us to learn about.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021151310	550	2		20131021192241	696	2		20131023074828	560	2

We have been asked to give information on different jobs for people that are interested in history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are lots of jobs for people that are interested in history like archeologists, historians and much more. I think it would be fun to be one of these because I could uncover stuff like bones, bodies, and secrets. But even though it sounds fun it is still dangerous because there could be traps from back then.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists use many tools like a pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel all these tools are used to uncover artifacts that go in museums and other places that store these items.even though there is more they use I can't tell yuo all of them because I dont know them all.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That is why being and archeologist is very hard and takes a little skill but not allot. It would be fun, dangerous and maybe scary for some people but it just sound fun to me which is why I might become an archeologist when I am older!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022131534	927	1		20131022141701	535	1

Archeologists find some objects from the ground, and study about them. They need to be careful and take a time while they are working. They use a lot of equipments, too. Since they study about old things, they can know many things about past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists dig the ground to discover objects. The process of digging requires hard working because it is really a difficult work. They even needed more than a year to find Washington home. They have found many things from the ground. For example, they've found a part of building, and pieces of pottery.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use a lot of equipments to discover objects. They use 3D computers that can track what is underground, and they record the information so that people sill know what it looked like before. And, they remove thin layers of soil with small, flat and sharp skim shovels. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen, and this lets the dirt fallout while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling, and it is when archeologists use some tools to remove dirt. Also, archeologists study the objects that are found.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it is worth it because we can know about past. For example, the trash that settlers threw away help us understand how the people lived. We can know what the settlers did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. Discovering objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago is exciting. And, it gives us a piece of our past, too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, archeologists find objects from the ground by digging it with many equipments, study about them, and learn a lot about past. Archeologists are really helpful in our life, and they are necessary for us.</p>	2		20131022131441	927	2		20131022140954	551	2		20131023100715	560	2

Usually, archeologists start with a pic and</p> <p>a shovel. Then, when they find an artifact, they then use a whisk and dustpan to brush off dirt and dust off artifacts. Then when they are done they get a wheel barrow so they can move the items to another place. Also, the most common item is a trowel.

They go out and dig for hours a day to find new discoveries of how life was a ling time ago. From colonial times to dinosaurs.</p> <p>&nbsp; Have you ever asked yourself, how do archeologists do their job? Well archeologist have to do many things to discover anything. There are different teams that do different things in the process of finding artifacts. on team digs around in the dirt to fin the artifacts. Another team scans the area with 3-D computers to see if there is anything under the surface . There is also a team that stays at the lab and studies these artifacts. It is a lot of hard work to do a job like this, archeologist need all the help they can get. THere can even&nbsp; be 35 people on one team.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Argeoligist have to use specific tools to do their job. The tools that they use are; picks, shovels, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Archeologists use a shovel and a pick to dig some of the dirt to get closer to the artifact. Archeologists use a whisk and a dust pan to brush of some dirt covering the artifact or to see the artifact more clearly. They use a knife by carefully scraping the dirt from around the artifact. To use a wheelbarrow in a excavate you put the artifacts or excess dirt inside of it. Skim shovels are used to carefully remove a very thin layer of dirt with every scoop. Finally a trowel, probably the most frequently used tool, is used to&nbsp; scrape/cut different layers of soil than the argeoligist studies the soil.</p> <p>&nbsp; As you can see the process of digging up artifacts is a long and tiresome process.

So they made a project called Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was formed to find the secerts of James Fort in Jamestown Virginia. For over 200 years people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area had hinted that it might still be around.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Fort was built in 1607. The settelers came to England to start a new life. Some people thought that James Fort was built near a river. The first oblects were found in 1861. Archaeologists the name for sciancetists who study objects from the past, undiscovered armor, weapons, and the floor of buildings. Over 100 years later a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began. The National Park Service led a 5 year study to find out how the land was used.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thats when they finally found James Fort!

Most people think history is boring, but I like it its my favorite subject.&nbsp; Archeologists study things like dinosaurs, plants, bones, and pottery. This is a great way to learn about history. Some study our presidents past and colonial life back from the 1800's.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can learn about your ancestors. They use special tools like pickaxe, skim shovel, and a whisk.&nbsp; Archeologists, mostly study bones from animals and humans from the past. Sometimes it takes two weeks or more to dig a twenty five square foot area that's long! They've dug up some of Fort James and Washington's child hood home!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist's have to take many history classes just to be who they are. It may take a year just to dig up twenty artifacts or less. I wouldn't choose this path if you don't like history, but I do. It took three years to dig up artifacts from Washington's home. Finding Washington's home was important for many reasons.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also led a five year expedition trying to find James Fort. No one Knew where Washington's home was. The first buildings found was the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage room. They also found burnt pottery and piece of a clay pipe.

The process is careful. Many people will work in the site. They map out the area using computers that find things in the ground. They use that information before they start digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other people dig. They dig at an area called a dig. They use skim shovels that are so sharp they can remove layers of dirt at a time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people use a process called troweling. This is when they use equipment to remove dirt from the artifacts. It can take two weeks to do a 25 square foot area. This whole thing is tiresome.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discovery Washington's home is important. It helps understand things about George Washington. It also helps understand the decisions he made.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kids can get involved in this. They run classroom and outside activities.

They started Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was created to find the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. Many investigations in that place hinted that it can still be around. Over 200 years, people were thinking that the fort was washed away by a river.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fort was constructed in 1607 when people went from England to here. They did that so they can launch a new life. Many people believed that James Fort was built by the river. It was more simple to put ships there. So it had made sense that they would want to pick that spot. Things that&nbsp; were found close by suggested that the fort was more far away. The new place probably went to give the people several more protection from bad ships.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objects that were found first were discovered in 1861. Archeologists found out about the floors of constructing. Past 100 years, a team effort to discover the same place where the fort&nbsp; constructed had began. They were the Archeologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had finally found James when people were doing the study used computer searching software to make an image of the area. The object that they found first was a bunch of marks on the floor. The marks had showed where the fort's walls had been before. During all the stories that had been heard and read, and pictures they they had constructed, the archeologists found out that&nbsp; the fort would look like a triangle. They constructed maps and discovered that the fort expanded all the way to the lake. Then the learned there were rock ledges constructed&nbsp; past the lake. The ledges were created to hold things. The archeologists had also discovered eleven cellars, 12 of burial sites, and ten buildings within all the borden of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned many things about archeologists. Archeologists are wonderful scientists. They are very smart and intellagent. I am very glad that I learned many things about them. I had realized that they can do many things. In concluson, I am so happy that I learned about them.</p>	1		20131022225212	509	1		20131025090021	533	1

They also have a wheelbarrow to move dirt out of the site , or a heavy item. The last item they talk about is a knife.

You would never get board with this job. You get to dig all day long. Also you get to discover things from famous peoples life.Last you get to work with really cool tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, of all you have to dig , dig, and dig.With this job you either stay outside and dig or you stay outstide and study some things. I am here to talk about the diging part. These are the steps:first you find the perfect spot to dig. second you use a shovel thats really thin and sharp to just get up thin layers of dirt so you don't mess up any artifacts. third you carefully carry the extra dirt off the site with a wheelbarrow.fourth you bring the artifacts back to the lab for the other workers to study them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, you get to discover things from famous peoples lifes. Some of those people might be like George Washington or other presidents! Archeologists recently did a search for things from George Washingtons childhood. They knew were to look because his house had burned down when he was a kid and the found some burnt pottery.After they knew they had found the right spot they started digging for the underground part of the house. It took over a year but they finaly found it! Turns out that they found a kitchen,slave quarters,and some storage houses!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last,you get to work with some cool tools.Some of those cool tools are a wheelbarrow,knife,trowel, and a pick.The wheelbarrow is used to carry extra dirt off the site.The knife is used for careful digging and to remove some of the dried dirt of the artifacts.The trowel is the most common tool it is used to scrape or cut to see the different layers of soil.Last the pick is used to dig in close to artifacts in the earth.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see being a Archeologist is a pretty amazing job. You get to dig all day long. Discover artifacts from famous peoples life.Last you get to work with really cool tools.So go be a Archeologist when you grow up!</p>	1		20131021091516	550	1		20131021095154	925	1

There is three things that are most important of&nbsp; being an archeologist these are the dig, the tools, and the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dig is very important because it's basically everything. First the archeologist has to find a place and why he's going to dig there once it took a group archeologist one year to find what they where looking for! Archeologist then dig and work for years to uncover whatever they're digging for. They also have to remove the dirt from the object by using a knife or a whisk.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools that a archeologist are awesome! They use a shovel to dig up the area it would be very hard for an archeologist not to have a shovel. They use a whisk and dustpan or a knife to remove all the dirt from the object the object would be very dirty if they didn't do this. Also they use a wheelbarrow to carry the objects and to carry dirt from the site.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The job of an archeologist is hard and boring but fun at the same time. An archeologist usually have to wait a few years to find an object. At the same time when they do find an object it's awesome to learn more about the history of it! An archeologist has to dig a lot but that's not all they have to do they have map out the area using a 3D computer and take the objects to a lab to study.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you have read about arechologist maybe youll want to be one. I s ure do! I have tought you about the long dig, the tools they use, and the job.</p>	1		20131021141050	927	1		20131021152108	550	1

From that image archeologists can find clues such as marks,debris etc. After they find the area, they send in teams of 10-35 people. to use computers to find artifacts underground, and to dig out the area to find the mapped items. Finally, they use the artifact to tell them more about history.</p>	1		20131021091837	223	1		20131021105938	696	1

The group was called the Jamestown Rediscovery Arcaeological Project. The fort was built in 1607 when the English settlers arrived in North America to start a new life. The fort was originally built near the river. They decided to move to a new spot where they'd have more protection from enemies and their ships. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists (the name for scientists who study objects from the past) found all kinds of things.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131021090849	547		N	20131021113747	516		N

You have to try and try as i'm guessing i don't think archeologists ever give up until they find what they want, if i were to be an archeologists i will never give up until i find what i am looking for. As a little girl i will still try my hardest to find what i am looking for.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologists job is very important and very intresting because they get to learn about things from the past like dinosaurs and other types of animals. If i were to be an archeologists i would love to learn about the past, my favorite subject is american history it may be hard and boring but i love it. The only reason i love it is because you get to learn about presidents and other people like louis and clark i also love to learn about presidents lifes when they were in their childhood. An archeologists job is great they will get a lot of money for discovering things from the past like dinosaur bones and all that kind of stuff, they will also get to learn a olt about world history and they will get the chance to touch bones and other types of stuff. I am not trying to lie but maybe one day i would love to be an archeologists, maybe someday you would too, you may not like to learn things about the past, but when you actually get the chance to learn about it i will geranty you that you will love it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who is an archeologists must be greatful of being an archeologists because they get to learn alot about the past. I may not be an archeoogists but i say that it is a great job to earn money and to get to learn alot about the world, they also get to look at things that they have never seen before, they also get to touch things they have never got to touch before. For all the people who are archeologists i wish you guys good luck and hope you guys have a wonderful life with what you guys are doing to help alot of people figure out what the meaning of archeologists, it may help a lot of people to know that learning in school is not just a joke it is very serious because if you don't take it serious than you will not get no where in life well hope you liked my report and hope you actually learned something from my report.</p>	0		20131021093321	925	1		20131021103606	563	0		20131021222056	509	0

You guys might think its easy now but believe me just let me tell a little about what an archeologist really does.After i tell you guys this you might still think its easy or hard or you might think that it is to hard and you wont want to think of doing that job ever again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An&nbsp; archeologist is areally hard job they have to dust of objrcts that are long befor any of us were born.They have to study about hoe long ago these things were made they also have to study peoples houses that might of been made in like the 1600's. The job for anyone is going to be hard. People that are archeologist have to study George Washingtons house that he lived in when he was a little boy.they have to study almost everthing that was done in the past. They might find any thing such as coins,bowls,broken down things they can find almost anything basically that was from the past a long time ago.&nbsp; They could even find George Washington's clothes if they still</p> <p>exist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So what im trying to say is that archeologist to me i would love to dig up things that famouse people used from the past . I would love to do every thing that archeologist do now like dig up things&nbsp; from the past or discover how people treated anchient things but it would be tiering doing all of that every day and i would have to learn everthing about being an archeologist.

Archeologists find information about people in the past who are not living now. Some people might think their job is easy and some people think it is hard. It is just your opinion but i think their job is hard because sometimes it takes you a long time to really find any artifacts. In these paragraphs you will learn about what tools they use, how they use them, and what they do.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The tools that archeologists use are picks and shovels, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and a trowel. Most digs start with picks and shovels. They are used to dig into the ground and find the artifacts they are looking for. A whisk and a dustpan are used to brush the dirt off of artifacts. A knife is used to dig carefully and scrape dirt off of the artifacts. A wheelbarrow is used to move artifacts from one place to another. Skim shovels are shovels with a flat edge used to remove a very thin layer of dirt carefully. The last tool that an archeologist uses is a trowel. Trowels are used to scrape and cut the dirt to view the different layers of dirt.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists find artifacts by digging for long periods of time. They have to plan how to and where to dig before they start digging for real. Sometimes they use a 3D computer to track and map what is underground. Some archeologists just start digging in the first place and see what they find. If they use a 3D computer to map the area out they have to record the information of where to dig so they know what the artifact looks like before they start digging. If they are focusing on the actual digging, they start with skim shovels. Archeologist then put the little layers of soil dug up in boxes with half-inched screens on the bottoms. This lets soil go through the screen and leaves back artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This report was about the job of an archeologist. Now you know what type of tools they use and how they use them. It takes a few years sometimes to finish an area.If I wrote this report again I would write it about how archeologists earn their job. Since I learned more about being an archeologists I believe it would be fun to have this job.</p>	2		20131021092426	927	2		20131021112741	559	2

In the Washington project they had fond a celler and started to dig for artifacts.</p>	1		20131021151420	925	1		20131021153912	535	1

Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia for a long time people thought it had all been just washed away by a river. Some things they found made people feel like there was something still there.</p> <p>This fort was built in 1607 when England settlers came to start a new life. Everybody thinks it was built somewhere near or beside a river. It would be easier to park ships there.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The first objects were found there in 1861. They found undercovered armor and weapons. They also got to find floors of differnt buildings. Over 100 years later they tried to find the exact spot where it was built began. The people doing this study used a computer mapping software to make an image of this area. Thats when they finally found James Fort. So thats one of the places they found very old items.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; They also tried to find information on George Washingtons past. Recent discoveries have been recorded to let historans know more about Washingtons childhood. His father moved his family to Ferry Farms. George was only six. They started diging in 2003. It took over a year. But they finally found it.</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologist use many tools haer are a few pick,shovel,knife,and,many more.

The archeologist had to do a lot of research to figure out which house was Washington's. The way they figuured out was that they found out that Washington's house had caught on fire, and in one of the houses they found pieces of burnt poetry. They also found a clay pipe and they new that Washington smoked clay pipes. So archeologist dont have a simole job. They have to very patient and careWhen your an archeologist you have to be carefull. You have to be carefull&nbsp; because if they were to find something very valuable and they were to drop it would brake and then be useless. Archeologist have many tools to help keep them safe and whatever they find safe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do Archeologist find all of this stuff including the stuff in and around Washington's house? Archeologist that were on the Washington case split up on to teams and each team checks a diferent area. They also have 3-d computers that can track whats under ground. these computers help them alot so that they can find whatevers under the ground a lot faster. One team focuses on the diging part. Those archeologist start their dig with a skim shovel.Another archeologist team spends the day in the lab. The information gathered from the 3D computers is recorded.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist have meany tools and each one has their on thing. They have a pick and shovel. They have a whisk and dustpan. They have knife. They have a wheelbarrow. They have a skim shovel. They have trowel.</p>	0		20131021190326	559	0		20131022113925	563	0

I am 11 years old. I go to Woodfeilds Elementry. In this report I will teach you about the job of an archeologist. I decided to pick ( I did not really pick it.) this topic because I did not know much about them. In the report you will learn about how archeologists found Fort James, how archeologists learned more about George Washington's child hood, and about the tools used by archeologists. I hope you enjoy my report.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First in 1994 a group of people got together so they could study the past of&nbsp; James Fort in Jamestown. They wanted to set up an archaeological project. For over two huundred years people thought the town had been detroyed, but some discoveries were found that revealed that it might still be there.When the archeologists finnally found the area where the fort was they started digging.The first objects were found in 1861, when</p> <p>archeologists found weapons, and armor.One hundred years after that they found some more. Now we have found over 1 millon things, including pots, coins, toys, and tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have talked about Fort James, let us discuss how archeologists helped us find more about George Washington. Archeologists found where Washington lived as a child, it took them a couple years but they did it. A few houses had been discovered so they looked for more. They found burnt pottery and a clay pipe so they confirmed that that location was were Washington lived. Archeologists work on a team to find artifacts, so thirty-five people can be on a team.It takes sevearl&nbsp; teams to find an artifact.For example it can take up to two weeks or more to dig an twenty-five square foot area.thats why it is a big deal if, say you found one tiny bit of burnt pottery, scientists cound scan that pottery and find out a lot about where that pottery has been. That is how we found out about George Washington's childhood.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have to have tools when they find artifacts. One of their tools are the pick and shovel. Archeologists use the pick and shovel to dig into the the Earth to find artifacts.Archeologists also use the Wisk and dustpan. They use these items to brush of dirt&nbsp; from the artifacts. Archeologists use the knife as one of their tools too. The knife helps them scrape dirt away from the artifact. A lot of archeologists use the wheelbarow to help them carry dirt away from where they are digging, it also helps them carry the artifacts away from the excavation site. Most archeologists use the Skim shovel to dig into the soil to take a slim layer of soil off, they are able to do this bacause the skim shovel has a flat edge. The most common tool that archeologists use is the Trowel. The Trowel is used to cut the different layers of soil off so you can see them. Those are some of the tools that archeologists use.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This report was about the job of an archeologist. In this report I told you about how archeologists woked on Fort James, how archeologists learned more about George Washington's child hood, and about the tools used by archeologists. I learned some things too, when I was writing this report. I learned that archeologists use Trowels and Skim shovels. I also learned that archeologists found a trash pile in Fort James. Thank you for reading my report. I hope you enjoyed it.</p>	2		20131022131140	554	2		20131022133654	223	1		20131023112646	560	2

I go to Woodfeilds Elementary School. This essay will be about how important the job of an archeoligist's is. They have a lot of specail tools that the use. Archeoligists have a very big role in this world. They have changed history many times.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I am going to talk about the different tools that archeoligists use. They use such things as a pick and shovel, a whisk and dust pan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel and a trowel. These tools are very important in the process of archeology. It takes a long time to use these tools properly; because they need to be really carefull not to break the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I am going to tell you about how archeoligists affect the world. An archeoligist's job is to discover historical figures (artifacts) that are not yet discovered. For example: Archeoligists wnt to Ferry Farm, knowing that George Washington lived there as a boy. They used the appropriate tools and found out that it was George Washington's home, with the proof of pieces of burned pottery and part of a clay pipe.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeoligists find millions of artifacts, changing history every day. They work very hard and focus carefully. I learned that archeoligists have such a big role on the Earth. I am glad that we have archeoligists today!</p>	2		20131022131122	547	2		20131022132711	925	1		20131024075641	509	2

An archeologist is a person who discovers and digs up artifacts, items of the past, and fossils. Archeologists can use special tools to help them discover artifacts and fossils. They also have a procedure and they can dig up certain items.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Some tools that archeologists use are picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. The pick and shovel are used to dig up the soil above where something might be. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush off dust and dirt. Wheelbarrows were used to move dirt or items to another place. A skim shovel is used to remove very thin layers of soil. The trowel scrapes and cuts layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; To dig up artifacts in a certain area, a team of archeologists first map out a place to find out what is underground. Then, another group of archeologists do the actual digging for items in the area that is mapped out. They use the skim shovel to remove layers of soil to find items. Archeolgists use another method called troweling too. troweling uses shovels, brushes, and picks to remove dirt. After the artifacts are found, another team of archeologists studies the objects that the second team found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Most things archeologists will find are artifacts and the fossilized bones of animals. Archeologists can find ancient pottery, paintings, metal items, tombs, and toys. If archeologists are searching for fossils, they can find the remains of dinosaurs and long-ago plants and animals. There are some places that are good sources of fossils and artifacts, such as the La Brea Tar Pits in Southern California, or the Egyptian pyramids.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Being an archeologist can be fun, but it can also be dull and tiring, especially if you can not find anything. But if an archeologist finds something fascinating, like King Tut's coffin, he/she could become world renowned. Archeology is an interesting subject.</p>	1		20131022114355	695	2		20131022142113	555	2		20131023130402	516	1

Archeologists use shovels, picks, whisk and dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. Shovels and picks, which is like a pickaxe, are used for digging, they're the main digging tools. Whisks and dustpans are like little brushes and dustpans, they are used for brush dirt off of artifacts and to clear dirt away. Knives as an archeology tool aren't used the same way as normal knives. They're used to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrows</p> <p>move dirt from one place to another. Skim shovels are a type of shovel that have a flat edge. Can be used to carfully remove a thin layer of soil.

This fort was buit in 1607 and said that it was built near a river and washed away, until archeologisit were intrested and started to wonder until curiosty hit them. In 1861 Archeologist found old armor and weapons also some of the buildings floor. This was a huge impact for everyone that at least they got a clue about James fort. 100 years past and a group of archeologisit&nbsp; started to dig where James fort was built, The national park helped them and gave them a five year study so they could have an idea how the land was used at that time. Alot of the archeologist used technology to find James fort and eventually they found what they were looking for James fort, they found very intersting things that they could've never learned&nbsp; like the fort was shaped like a triangle etc etc etc. Today they find even more stuff and still learn alot about the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington the first president. George Washington life before the american hero was unknown like where was his house, did he own land etc etc etc. Over 12,000 years peole haved lived on a place called Ferry Farm&nbsp; this place was perfect for people who were a normal family back in the olden days, Augustine Washington father of George Washington&nbsp; had the same idea like everyone did. No one knew where he lived because it wasnt there anymore. 2003, Archeologist&nbsp; had an idea to dig up the past and find were George lived before he was famous. It took a year of hard work and alot of dirt to find George Washingtons home,eventually they werent sure if they found the right place untill they found a clay pipe, this pipe gave a huge clue because George Washington smoked clay pipes. They didnt just find clues they found 3 buildings there was the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses. This people used advanced technolgy to help dig up the past and also they used Archeologist tools like pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan,knife,wheelbarrow, skim shovel,and of course a trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist play a huge part in history. This week i've been really intrested into the past and how it's found by Archeologist,I learned about what they use what they want to see and many more. Archeologist have founded may diffrent things we can learn about and see it, they reasearch what they need to find,most important what the need to see.this Whole test had made me thing beyond the box like Archeologist do, I hope the Archeologist soon find a new adventure and share it with others.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021161235	516	1		20131022143742	934	1		20131023081434	509	1

Also you need to be good at digging stuff up, because that is what fifty percent of your job. You would have to reaserch many many things that is already known and then you have to prove it by finding the artifacts and showing it to who ever owns the company or someone who ordered you company to find the artifact to prove it. Its a lot of work, but for some people, its a chance to meet someone who has the same interests as you.</p> <p>One thing you would have to do is to get a assignment and look uop stuff about it. So say if you need to prove that Ben franklin made the glasses, you would have to look where ever his workshop or home was. Then you would have to dig around until you find some blue prints or tests and ideas. Thats one thing you would have to do.</p> <p>Another thing you would have to do is to write up a report on the stuff you have found in the area that you have dug in. You would have to take every single&nbsp; thing that you have found in the digging area and say what it shows to a regular person. Because if you write in your perspective, people who have found the information may not understand it. Thats pretty much the last thing you would really need to do.</p> <p>But the last thing you really need to do is post your report onto the internet VIA skype to one website owner like wikipedia or give your report to a publisher. Then you would have to wait until you are givin another assignment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021192119	551	1		20131022100410	535	1

It will help archeologists find what they are looking for such as, old fossils or bones.&nbsp; A whisk and dustpan can be used to brush off the dirt and dust the objects or artifacts have on top of them. Archeologists can use these tools to find pottery or old plates and cups. A knife can be used to dust off the dust, dirt, or any other dusty particle around the item or artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologist can do many things like dig up history, old stories, old objects and artifacts.

Whisk &amp; Dustpan: Used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away form the dirt from the excavation site. Knife: Used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Wheelbarrow: Used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. Skim Shovel: A shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer soil with each scoop. Trowel: Probably the most common tool in archeology.

The kids can sign up for classes and pay games make new freinds and learn more about more about Geroge Washington.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The archeoligist used picks and shovels to dig up lots of dirt at once and they used picks to break off stone and other hard objects.They also used a whisk for dusting of dirt to see the artifact clearly and wheelbarrows for get large amounts of dirt to dig fpr the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021193135	554	1		20131022105350	516	0		20131022143727	533	1

Well, here are some other amazing digs that made the job worth-while.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994, some people interested in the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project. They wanted to find the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For 200 years, everyone thought the fort had been taken by the river. But some things found in the area hinted that it might still be there. The fort was made in 1607, at the same time the English Settlers came. The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists discovered armor and weapons. They also found the floors of buildings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 100 years later, a group set out to find the exact spot where the fort had been built. The people diong the study used computer mapping to create a picture of the area. And that's when they found James Fort! The first thing they found were marks on the ground. They showed where the walls used to be. From everything they had researched, they knew the fort would be triangle shaped. They also found that it streched to the river. Today the archeologists find about 1 million objects every year!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you can see why being an archeologist is so fun. I mean, they found a whole forrt!

They get to see all the artifacts that they get,but its a lot of work to find the artifacts,too. Let me explain what I mean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all,they have to get all the research and then get the tools. They have to get things from 3D computers to dust pans. They also have teams to make it easier. The teams can be up to thirty five people! They also have to find out about other things that were found in the area to see if what their trying to find is still there. Then they start the hunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They find the spot where they need to start first. They use those 3D computers to try and find things under the ground. They may only dig 25 square feet in 2 weeks! The whole thing is very slow, but in the end its worth it. Once they find the artifact,it has to be cleaned. It is a great job, but it is very important. In the end it all comes together,the artifact goes where it belongs,and they wait for their next trip.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022131943	695	2		20131022142113	555	2

Archeologists who studied objects from the past, uncovered armor and weapons. They discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the axact spot where the fort built began.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>the National Park Service led five-year study of tue area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decide where the proof of the fort. The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area.

They have to go to different places to try to find undiscovered</p> <p>artifacts about one person. Say they're trying to find artifacts of Cleopatra, they'd go to were she came from ( Egypt ) and try to find artifacts. That's were the name artifacts came from ( Archeologists ). Although there job sounds easy, it's very dangerous and hard! When they're in caves trying to find artifacts, the cave could cave-in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists can have the hardest jobs on earth! Going to find artifacts about just ONE person is super hard! Man, sometimes I can't even find facts about people in books, let alone finding their past?! I think not. First off, you have to go to where their old house was and search it. Second off, you need to find a lot of their pictures to tell who they were. Third off, you have to know a lot about that person! You also have to know a lot about how they lived, who they lived with, how many family members they had, and what they did for a living.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br> If you want to be an archeologist when you're older, I suggest you start studying some people right now! Finding artifacts is like finding something when it's lost, lost history! When you lose something, it's very hard to find right? If you answered yes, then imagine trying to find something that's been lost for hundreds even sometimes thousands of years! If you answered no, then man you're crazy! People who live in the same place for their whole life make it easier to find artifacts, but people who have moved around the world a lot, make it <b>VERY</b> hard!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you can see finding artifacts is not all so easy. You must go through a lot of steps before you start looking for artifacts. You have to have all the right tools, the right gear, and especially the right type of people to help you!</p> <p>If you want to be an archeologists when you're, just remember I warned you!

Also, make sure you don't BREAK the artifact. You need to make sure you go to the right location not 100 miles of or 1yd. off. Also, when you find the artifact you need to contact the general. When you brush the dust off you need to collect everything around it. While you brush it off you need to give it to the general.</p>	2		20131021102917	547	2		20131021111850	555	2

They needed to find his familys house because we did not know much about his childhood. The Archeolgists task was to find were his home was lokated on Ferry Farms. Using 3.D maps and tools they were abel to find it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another inportant dig they dug was finding Fort James in James town from one of the first colenies. Some peopole thought that it had been washed away by the river. But the archeolgists pruved them rong. They aculy found the exact spot were it had been built.Its pretty cool to know what archeologists can find.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have lots of special tools for on the dig sites. (1) They have a pick and a shovel, they use these tools to start the dig by clearing away the top layer(s) of dirt. (2) they have something called a whisk and a dustpan, the whisk is used to brush dirt off of artifacts or off the exevation site, they use the dust pan with the whisk. (3) They use a knife for careful digging and to scrape hard dirt off of the artifacts.(4) They use a wheelbarrow for obviuse reasons(like caring dirt away from the dig site). (5) They use a specail tool called a skim shovel, that has flat edges, to remove a thin layer of soil with every scoop. (6) The last tool they use is a trowel, this is probebly the most comen tool, and they use it to scrape, and cut to veiw the soil from different angels. Now you know all the tools that they need, and how they use them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists are like detectives with with tools and an inportat job to solve the mysterys past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022132450	926	1		20131022143016	925	1

A archeologist is a person that uses many tools to dig up different artifacts from many different locations. Those artifacts help us learn more about history. It is exiting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of digging is a careful one. It takes patience, and many hard workers. The many people who dig are on a &quot;team.&quot; There can be up to thirty-five people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.All the information is used to show where the workers need to start and what to use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another type of team works on the actual digging. Where they dig, is called a &quot;dig.&quot; they start with a tool called a &quot;Skim shovel.&quot; The skim shovel is used to get the first few layers of dirt off. It can do this because of its shape. The skim shovel is is small, flat, and sharp.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A technique called troweling is also a way to dig up artifacts. They archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes and wooden picks to remove the dirt off of the artifacts. Sometimes, it takes up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five square foot section. A different team from the two you have already learned about, spends a whole day examining artifacts in a lab.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, do you think your going to be a archeologist? Your going to have to be a patient and hard worker!</p>	2		20131021092038	695	2		20131021095027	535	2

In source #2 it is about George Washington these people wanted to dig up his house so they had to do a lot of work it took one year for them to do it but they found it but they wanted to make sure that was his house and it was. On source #3 is how the archeologists use there tools to do stuff and it tells you that you need to be careful to use them but some it says that how they were used in the story and it gives you some pitures of the tools how they look like and for you could see them too.</p>	T		20131021201657	551		T	20131022105726	542		T

Then after that you take clues thta you have found and put them together and to get an idea of what you are doing. The thing after that is to go looking for the object you need to find.After you find the object and mark were it is so thta you can find it again. Then you get your tools and go digging with help from other people. You will then either take the object if it is a bone or if it is a house witch you would leave for people to see it with permisstion. That is what a archeologist does. &nbsp;</p>	1		20131021193055	550	1		20131022102352	223	1

Archiology is also what helps scientists, historians, kids, and adults about the history of our great country, including some of our great people, and places.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our archiologists great finds have been: Georg Washington's house, and Fort Jamestown.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Washington's farm is been under I guess you could say reconstrudtion since 2003. This is a long, and hard process. It took the archiologists over a year to find evidense, but they finally found some. There was about 5 settlements on Ferry Farm, the land in which George Washington, our first president, lived on. This house was extreamly hard to find sinse the land was so big, and the archiologists weren't exactly shure which house was George Washington's at first. The evidence that one find was George's house was; clay cigars, and burnt pottery. This was an important find.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The find of George Washington's house as a young boy growing up was important for our country. This is because the dig helps is understand what George was like as a child/ brfore he became famous. This was also important because the find gives us information on what decisions George made, and how people in these colonial times lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is only one of the many reasons that archilogists are important.</p>	2		20131022114856	542		T	20131022140924	559	1		20131023100939	533	2

Archeologists are scientists who study object from the past. Archeologists use a lot of tools, and I will tell what they use in a minute.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools archeologists use are pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. All of them are used for digging up or cleaning artifacts</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick and shovel are probably the first tool archeologits use. The pick and shovel are use to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, excavation means to get rid of something or someone.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knife is used also for digging, but carefully, and is also used to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another ot to carry dirt away from the excavation site.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trowel is the final tool I'm talking about and its probably the most common too for acheologists to use. The trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you enjoy knowing what archeologists' job is and what tool do they use.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131024075458	77	1		20131024075958	509	1

For over 200 years, people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around.However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was located further away.The new spot probably gave the settlers more protection from enemy ships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131018153811	563		N	20131018182647	695		N

This essay tells you how they work on digging sites, why they must be careful and patient while digging, and what benefits their digging. Remember there is more to archeologists then you think.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists are split up into teams. The first one of these teams map the area with three-dimensional computers. Those computers track what is underground so that the archeologists will know what the site looks like before they start digging. The second team does the actual digging. They start digging with a special shovel called a skim shovel which can remove a thin layer of dirt with each single scoop. Then the soil is put in a special container that has a 1/2 inch screen at the bottom that lets all of the dirt out at the bottom while the artifacts stay in. Then the archeologists use paint brushes, small shovels, and wooden toothpicks to remove dirt in a process called troweling. The final team studies the objects that were found on the site in a lab.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This whole process takes a long time, and you might want it to be over with. But you must be patient with your work! The people who dug up the site and found George Washington's house said that it took a year to find the slave quarters, kitchen, and storage houses. It took even longer to find the farmhouse. Plus, if you were not careful, you would dig right past the thing or place that you were trying to find.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But, something benefits all this hard work. When you do find what you were looking for it will teach you a little about world history. There is that and the fact that you discovered something that was lost in history for so many years.

They knew that this would help then decide where to look for proof of the fort.The people doing the study used computer mapping software to make an image of the area. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thats when they finally found James Fort!The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks showed where the forts walls used to be.Between all the stories they heard and read,and drawings they made,the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle.They&nbsp; made maps and found out that the fort stretched all the way to the river.The ledges were designed to hold canons.The archeologists also found eleven cellars,dozens of burial sites ,and 10 buildings all within the border of the fort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today,the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year.The objects include pottery,tools,coins,and even metal toys for children.In the 1600s,people used to throw their trash down n unused well or into a big pit.While digging in the area,the archaeologists found the trash the settlers threw away,including the bones of animals they ate.The imformation learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in James Fort lived.We now know how the settlers fought the Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.We also know what the settler did to survive the difficult years when they had little food. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; It is exciting to discover objects that were regularly used by people who lived hundreds of years ago.It gives us a piece of our past and ties us to people who fist started the American colonies. &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years.Its location makes it a perfect place to build a home.There for,its not surprising that George Washingtons father,Augustine Washington,moved his family there.Goerge Washington was just 6 years old at the time. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone.Howevr,archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there.They started digging in 2003.It took over a year,but they finally found it.The first buildings they found were the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses.They found the main farmhouse a few yeats later. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

They have to find the right information about it, and the germs that are on it to see if its really what they think it is. They have to use tools to get into it. They use tools to clean it, dust it off, and a wheelbarrow to bring it back if its heavy. If you ever want to be a Archeologist, you have to be very smart. Some Archeologists look for stuff in the 13 colones, because its where the Revolutionary war was, and people left some stuff behind. Others just stay in the united states and look for dinosaur bones, and other stuff. A trowel is probably the most important tool of all, it helps to scrape and cut layers of soil. They started digging the base of Washington home in 2003,&nbsp; it took over a year. It took a lot of work to find out if it was really George Washington house. Also, in 1994, a group of people started studying Jamestown, they were trying to discover James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia, for over 200 years, people thought James fort was gone.

The tools they use are picks, dustpans, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and a trowel. They start excavating by using the two tools a pick and a shovel. They use them by digging into the Earth near the artifacts. Another one of the tools they use are a whisk and dustpan they are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts and to clear away dirt from the excavation site. The other tools they use are knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovel, and trowel. They use knives by carefully digging around the artifact and to scrape dirt off of the artifact.

The project was called &quot;The Jamestown Rediscovery Archeological Project&quot; ; it was designed for archeologists to find the secrets of Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. When the fort was built near a river they decided to start at a river, but when they found objects somewhere else near the river the spot they found was probably safer than the place they were looking at first.

They use tools such as a skim shovel which take small layers of dirt off the ground at a time to check for artifacts.

Though some people might not realize it, but a lot of our history comes from an archeologists job. They find out things from the past. Now lets get into more detail about an archeologists job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologists job is to study things from he past. Archeologists do also need things to help them do their job properly and successfully. Some of these tools include,</p>  <br>technology such as computers and other special technology. <br>pick and shovel <br>whisk and dust pan <br>knife <br>wheelbarrow <br>skim shovel <br>trowel&nbsp; and so much more! Of course all these tools are used at least one time in an archeologists job. Lets find out what the purposes of these tools are. Technology is used for lots of things, such as researching the mystery they want to get more background information about, and lots of other things to. Archeologists usually start off digs with these two tools, a pick and shovel. These are used to dig into the earth, close to artifacts. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. A knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. Archeologists also us a wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. A skim shovel has a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Finally, a trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Those are just some of&nbsp; the tools archeologists use in their investigations. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did you know that it takes lots of time to uncover things that archeologists are out to find. Have you ever thought about this? Well actually archeologists have to be so careful with each tiny tiny or big big artifact, it actually doesn't even have to be an artifact, it could be information you found that could be key to solving what your looking for. They can't just guess or suppose, they have to do a lot of research even before they set out to find what their looking for. they really have to be precise or accurate. They have to get background information. Like if it was a building and it wasn't there anymore, than where was it when it was still standing. Also even after they have found artifacts it might not be the whole thing so if they do find another piece they would have to find the exact spot and glue and mold,etc. All in all it's like a puzzle, ( but a one million piece puzzle!) Now you see why it takes so long for an archeologist to complete their mission. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archeologists don't only discover the things their looking for, but sometimes they discover other things to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archeologists job isn't as easy as you think, it requires lots of things. An archeologist has a major impact on our history. Thanks to archeologists we know so much more of our history than we would have if their weren't any archeologists.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022110429	554	2		20131022130015	223	2

Archeologist find artefacts and many more. But sadly I can not write much about archeologist. So I am going to tell some storys about the history of archeologist. Then I am going to talk about the tools that they use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Back in 1994, a group of archeologist were interested in studing Jamestown, as a project. The project was for secrets of the fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The fort was built in 1607 when people came from England to start a hole new life. Lots of people belive that the fort was built by the river. So they could dock ships. The archeologist looked for objects. The first objects were found in 1861, they found armor and weapons. The National Park spent years on study of how the land was used. Then they finally found James Fort.The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. Today the groups find around 1 million objects each year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; People have lived in the land known as Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It was the perfect location to build a home. So Augustine Washington, George Washintons father moved his family there when George was just six. Archeologist belived that the stone base under the house is still there. So archeologist stated diging in 2003. First they found the kichen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then finally they found what they were loking for the stone base under the house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologist used several tools to find artefacts. They use Pick axes and shovels are used to dig into the dirt to find artefacts. The whisk and dustpan are used to brush of the dirt over the artifact, once the artifact is found. A knife is used to carefuly dig/ scrape the dirt around the artifact. A wheelbarrow is used to carry the dirt away and out of here. A skim shovel is used on its flat edge to carefuly remove a thin layer or dirt. A trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the diferent layers of the dirt or soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I talked about the tools that archeologist use. And I also talked about storys of archeologist. Now my report is done, I hope you learned something. And enjoide my report.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131022120140	535		N	20131022164812	926		N

This is when they had finally found James Fort it was the first thing that they had found was set of a marking on the ground. They had showed where the fort walls used to be at between the stories they heard about and read about and the drawing were made. The archeologists knew that Fort was would be shape as a triangle.

The project was a designed to discover the secrets of the james fort in Jamestown, virginia. The fort was built 1607 when settlers cam from England to start a new life. Most believed that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock ships there, so it made sense that the settlers would chose the spot.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists the name for the scienist wh study objects from the past, uncover armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built again. The National Park Service led a five- star study of the area to figure out how was the land was used.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thats when they finally found James Fort the first thing found was a set of marks on the ground. the marks showed the forts walls used to be. they made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way to the river. today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. the objects include&nbsp; pottery tools coins and even metal toys for childeren.</p>	N		20131021080850	554		N	20131021091411	926		N

Archeologists have special tools to help them dig up artifacts like picks, shovels, and wheelbarrows. It takes awhile before archeologists can do anything because they have to do a lot of research on the artifact they are looking for or something related to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists discover these artifacts for people to better understand the history of the artifacts. It also helps historians learn more about how people lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists sometimes start looking for an artifact and find tiny parts of it, but then they stop sometimes. Somebody else will sometimes lead a group and hopefully be more successful. It helps when archeologists find little bits and pieces around the area because then it gives them an idea where the site is they are looking for. Archeologists also work in teams. Each team works on a certain things like computers, where they are actually going to dig, and another team works in the labs studying the objects they found.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use a bunch of different tools whether it's people, technology, or stuff they use to dig, archeologists have big jobs.</p>	2		20131021092038	695	2		20131021095027	535	2

Well that is what I am her to tell you! Now I know what some of you guys are thinking ''why do I wnat to know about this''? Well I promise you that you are actually going to enjoy this roller coster ride while we are going in loops frome time to time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it all started a very long time ago. When we had world war l, world war ll the civil war, the french and indian war and so forth. Then when all of this was over and we finally had peace treatys started coming and acts. But then we kicked all of those British butts. We had peace again but also little by little everything is becoming older and older.When we started wondering a becoming curous we had what I call the science decade.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we started getting supplies and getting to work we started learning more and more about the history. That was when all the new science,math and history books started coming becuase we are finding new things bout he history. So just remember when you get new science, math,or history books it means that you are getting more information and details about everything.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now our achioligists are working really hard on this to makes us happy and more informed. They use many different cool types of tools such as the pick and shovel,the whisk and dustpan, the knife the wheel barrow, the skim shovel and the trowel. Now of course these arn't the only tools they use there are many more but I just thought I'd give you a idea.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you folks ever wonder how the archioligists get there names or study or ven how long it takes them to achomplish this? Well Imma tell you I dont know the exact time but I do have a idea. A really,really, long time. These people have to go to a university to get a degree or diploma just to get accepted in a job like this,but if your ever think about it it can be very fun and cool. Please remember though that you will not get accepted in a job like this if you dont study first! Now it even takes more time just find all these types of cool stuff becuase you need to find the stop, get the tool, start searching, and clean.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well now you have finished this roller coster ride and I hope you enjoyed it.Well at least you took a time back in history,that is something many people dont get to do,but you did today. Please remember you can be what ever you want. Also if you have a question about something that is still not solve dont worry it will soon.

The last team spends days in the lab studying the objects finding out what they are.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing that I learned is what tools they used.

Those are the tools the archeologist used to do their job.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are the several paragraphs I wrote on what I learned in Finding Fort James and Digging up George Washington's past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022112103	559	1		20131022140953	551	1

Some are newer, some are older. For example they dug up George Washingtons house. It was the one when he was 6 years old. They were amazed on what they found. Another project they did was the Fort James project. The fort was built in 1607 , which meant that if they found everything, it would be super old.

If you go to a museam, you would expect to see a dinosaur skeleton there. Well, when they find a fossil archeologists would clean the bones many times then very carefully dry them and try to put together the skeleton and see what type of dinosaur it would be. If it stood on four legs and had a very long neck and flat teeth, that would be a bracheosarus. If it was huge and stood on two back legs, had a huge skull, and had very tiny front arms that would be know as a Tyrannosaurus-Rex. Archeologists help people with every day life.

If you are wrong then the people will get mad at you because they wasted all there time digging at nothing.A archaeologist job is a very important job, because the help find objects to make the whole wide world know about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A main reason a archaeologist became one is probably because when the human saw what the man/woman did he probably went to school to become to inspire kids to become one and find new objects. To inspire kids about learning is a opportunity to actually teach them to become one some day and to set goals for some of them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second of all you can find out all the history of how Indians lived back in the day. If you wanted to reconstruct what a Indian village looked like. You could dig up artifacts make houses and in the huts put the artifacts and make a museum. That would be a great lesson to teach kids of natives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third of all when archaeologist found James Fort they found cellars for captives. Also they found burial sites for the deceased or perished.When they dug they found ten building probably for the family's to live in.After they dug they put all the artifact they found&nbsp; and gave it to the museum to show kids.T o actually get to handle into a museum is very cool so when you go to the museum you get to say hey that is my great work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last of all our greatest president Gorge Washington&nbsp; our archaeologist&nbsp; found were gorge&nbsp; lived when he was moved at the age of six.They found a building with the severvant's quarter's . Also a kitchen and a storage house to keep food in. Later they found proof that Gogre Washington lived there by records of a deed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why I&nbsp; think it is important to&nbsp; become a archaeologist so that you can change the world. You can find new artifacts that have never been heard of. You can make a muesuem too! Also find history. Last but not least you can search up on your greatest hero's!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022105519	559	1		20131022111147	223	1

This &quot;studying of the past&quot; began the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was designed to discover the secrets of Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia (one of the thirteen colonies). For over 200 years, people thought that Fort James had been washed away by a torrent. Some say that it might be around if archeologist discovered the area. Now, about a hundred years later, a group of archeologists teamed up to find the long lost artifacts of the now-old-and-historical Fort James. To help find the area of the fort, they rely on the National Park Service (which led a five-year-study of the area). The group of archeologists knew this would help them decide where to look for definite proof.</p> <p>When they reached Fort James, the first thing they saw where footprints on the ground. These marks showed where the fort's location used to be. But, that's the first thing they found, because today the group of archeologists had found one million of these artifacts now to be shown at a museum. These include pottery, tools, coins, and metal tools.</p> <p>One other unique find is the long lost tale of George Washington, his home, and the many artifacts that he had.</p> <p>A group of archeologists (different from the ones that discovered Fort James) teamed up to &quot;dig up&quot; George Washington's past. The archeologists made a trip to Ferry Farm to CAREFULLY dig up the artifacts George Washington had when he was six. First, information is collected before the dig. Meanwhile, another team of archeologists focused on the dig of Washington's past.&nbsp; This team started with small, flat, and sharp shovels called skim shovels. These shovels can only remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. Then, it's placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom, which lets dirt fall out while artifacts stay in. Archeologists also use troweling, another digging process. Troweling is when archeologists use wooden picks, small shovels, and paint brushes. Meanwhile, another team studies the artifacts. The dig is tiresome and torturous, but it's definitely worth the dig.</p> <p>Kids can also get involved with being an archeologist. In example, Ferry Farm can offer many kids to get involved, so they open the George Washington society, which runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activites. Kids can explore the site, learn about the life of a colonist, and become junior archeologists. Kids can also visit an interactive website.</p> <p>How to become an archeologist is simple. You just start with a pick or a skim shovel, scoop up the earth with a dustpan, then scrape off dirt with a knife, carry it away with a wheelbarrow, and then the troweling starts. It may not be a clean and short job, but it's worth the try. Just keep digging until you will find the long lost artifacts of a historical person!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131021145048	516	1		20131021155513	695	2		20131022134636	533		N

But it's your job to find and discover what the question had asked you. Some people that are interested in what hasn't been discovered yet become Archeologistses. Others just learn from books, the internet, or the news.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are an Archeologists you have to travel all around the world. Most Archeoloists like to dig up fossils, dinisor bones, or find any thing that used to be when the dinisors were alive ,others like to find famous peoples past such as their childhood. Some Archeologists go to China just to complete history.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Archeologists get dirty, wet, or even sunburned just to dig up history. Others try their best not to. Some don't even care. When they dig they use a pick and a shovel. When they hit something, they use a whisk and a dustpan. When they are done with that they use a knife to clear dirt around the artifact. As soon as there done with everything they use a wheelbarrow to take all the dirt away. Then they take it to the lab to be tested on. Maybe later they might see that artifact in the meusem.</p>	1		20131021201657	551	1		20131022093703	547	1

Most biogrophies don't really have information about his childhood. Or when he wasn't famous. When George Washington was six years old. When George got older he was in the military. Then when he got a little bit older and retired people nominated him to be the President Of The United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When George Washington died 12,000 years later&nbsp; in 2003 archeolegist started digging where George Washington used to live. It took them more then a year but they finally found what they were looking for that whole time. They found the main farm houses a few years later and many other things baried.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one knew exactly where George Washington lived. He lived in a building when he was younger than six. Archeolegist belived that the stone base under the house was still there.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few other houses were built when George lived there. And they knew one of them were George Washingtons. So they digged and digged and records show that there was a fire at the house. The people that dig found pieces of burnt pottery. They also found clay pipes. Now we know that George Washington smoked clay pipes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was 35 total people that found the evidence about George Washington. They found a lot of stuff that was George Washingtons. Now there are more people living where George Washington used to live.

So The National Park Service led a five year study and how the land was used.All of them knew that it would help them figure out where to look for proof of Fort James.All of the people doing the studying used computer mapping software to make a good image of where the fort might be.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That is when they found the fort.The first thing that they all found was a set of marks on the ground.The marks ment that is where the walls of the fort used to be.Between all of the stories that they heard and read,and the drawings that they made they just knew that it had to be in the shape of a triangle.They made maps and found out that the fort streached all the way to the river.Then all of them realized that there were stone ledges built on the side of the river.The ledges were made to hold canons.The archeologists also found eleven cellars, dozens and dozens of burial sites,and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And now today the group finds about one million artifacts each year!The objects they find are tools,pottery,coins, and even toys made out of metal.And now that Fort James is found the world is changed!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And the last thing is that you should always be getting involved with cool and fun activities for yourself and to learn more every single day!!!!!!!!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021134238	927	2		20131021181919	542	2

They take for ever jest to get started in the area because you will need a big space in order to get what they are looking for. It may take a week or longer to get started on the field or yard. The tools Archeologists use are a Pick,Shovel,Whisk,Dustpan,Knife,Wheelbarrow,Skim Shovel,Trowel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Archeology started over 20-30 years ago and it is still going today. I know someone who dug up a dog one time. It is hard work to dig underground because there can be gas lines,lava,high levels of carbon dioxide.

They started digging there in 2003. the first buildings they found were the Kitchen, slave quarters, and storage house. at least four other houses have been built on the ferry farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof that it was George Washington's farmhouse. Records show that Washington's had a fire in their house. The digger's found peises of burnt pottery, they also found part of clay pipe.We know that Washington smokeed clay pipes,so this discovery gives more proof it is the right house.</p>	N		20131022111359	535		N	20131022161138	925		N

To find artifacts in an area, the archeologist will need many teams, each team needs at least 35 archeologist. Each team will have their own part in their area. Each person will also use a set of tools. Let's take a look at the first team of archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first team uses 3D computers to map out the area and track whats underground. Information has to be recorded for people to know how it looked before they started to dig in the area. That is what the first team will do to search for artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another team comes in to work on digging.The team will dig in an area called a dig.Archeologist use small, flat and sharp shovels used to dig thin layers of soil called skim shovels. The soil is put into a box with a half inch screen at the bottom for the dirt to fall out and also use a technique called troweling, which is when they use mini shovels, paint brushes, and picks made out of wood to get dirt of the artifacts. Then the third and final team will work on the rest.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next team will soon take the artifacts to the lab. They will be taken to the lab to be studied and researched on. It will take days to study the artifacts. They also use different computers to research on the artifact. They will also tell what time period the artifact is from is due to what the artifact could be used for. This is was what the third team will do with the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many reasons why it's important to find artifacts.One reason why it is important to find artifacts to have proof of what happened in history. Another reason why is it tells us more about other famous people in history. One last reason is it could also tell more about other time periods. Those were a few reasons why archeologist search for artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are a few tools archeologist use that people commonly know. One tool is the trowel, the most known tool which is used to cut and scrape different layers of dirt or soil. Another tool is the skim shovel, its used to carefully remove thin layers of dirt. Other tools are the pick and shovel, they are mostly the first tool used in a dig. These were the most known tools used by archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tools are also used by archeologist, but are not known by most people. The first tool is the knife, which is used to scrape the dirt off of artifacts. A few other tools are the whisk and dustpan, it is used for to brush dirt away from the evacuation site. The last tool is the wheelbarrow, it can be used to carry dirt to certain areas. These were a few of the tools used by archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage told you about archeologist and what they do at their job. Such as what tools were used to find and research about artifacts. Another thing we learned is what role or part each archeologist have. We also learned why finding artifacts are helpful. Archeologist help us find out more about Earth's history.</p>	2		20131021094321	563	2		20131021104534	550	2		20131022212910	509	2

The archeologists sometimes have a hard time, they have a hard time from all the work they do and how much time they spend getting the job done. The job takes&nbsp; a long time because they need the area to be perfect. They also need to find artifacts to find out about the person or the thing that lived long ago. And they need a lot of tools to do that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Why do they need that many tools?</u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do they need that many tools? Good question, they need all those tools to do their work like shoveling.</p> <p>They use the tools pickaxe and shoveling and mining. They also use the whisk and dustpan to dust off dirt and dust from the old artifacts like vases from famous people's houses like George Washington. They also use the whisk and dustpan for cleaning the floor of the houses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Why do they need that many tools? (part 2)</u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that they even use a knife? They use a knife for Careful digging. They sometimes need the hole to be perfect. They also use the knife for scraping dirt and other things off&nbsp; the artifact. They also use it for cutting artifacts in half like some clay. Did you also know that the archeologists use wheelbarrows? Well they do, they use the wheelbarrow for carrying artifacts without breaking them. They break the artifacts by accidentally dropping them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Why do they need that many tools? (part 3)</u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is getting boring but lets get on with it. They also use a skim shovel. A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge so it can scoop more equally and less at a time. They use it for digging a perfect hole and to smooth out the dirt and other stuff. The archeologists also use a trowel it is probably the most common tool in archeology. They use to scrape and cut things off of the artifacts and they also use the trowel to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. And there is many more tools that they use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>How Important are archeologists?</u></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The archeologists are very important. They are important because they help us discover new things every day. They are also important because, If we didn't have them in our lives then they would be no discoveries about the past. They are important by helping people get new information. And they are important in many other ways.</p>	1		20131021192411	546	2		20131022131238	554	1		20131022223434	509	1

These tools for digging into the earth, close to artifacts. Archeologist also use a whisk and dust pan. It is used to brush dirt off artifacts and to clear dirt away from the artifacts. Archeologist dig up artifacts from animals and other things.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologist jobs takes a lot of work but its cool. They use 3-d computers to locate fossils. They dig up fossils or remains of things or people. They use tools like knife for careful digging or scraping dirt around the artifact. Archeologists is a fun job because you maybe can find dead peoples stuff and learn about them or maybe you can keep it and become rich.</p>	1		20131018145414	542	1		20131018153103	547	1		20131021091316	560	1

If you want to be an Archeoligist, you need to know these things about the archeoligist's life.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The job of a archeoligist is about research, finding atifacts of the american people who once lived here in the USA. They dig up dirt and rocks under our feet and they go to computer and look underground where is the artifacts is. After all, it's not all about digging and going on the computers, sometimes it looking around in the place where the artifacts is. For example, archeoligists found in Washingting's&nbsp; house were picture on the walls and vases. Some people are often enjoying archeoligist so much, but people often hates archeoligist. Archeoligist search for the 1600s-1800s artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeoligist goes to states to states to find these artifacts that they research in the computer. They also use some other tools that some people had never seen or use in there lifes. Like a skim shovel, exact knife, a trowel, whisk and dustpan, and a wheelbarrow for digging up artifacts. These tools are perfect digging artifacts just to let you know. Arceoligist maybe a adult or grandpas, I think.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People study really hard to go to this job as a archeoligist. Archeoligist use alot of tech to do this digging expectation, they go outside and walk to the artifacts they found under ground. People in the past like the 1800s or the 1900s go to these places with less tech! Archeoligist are proud of this job about digging, walking, using strange tools, and researching of all these things that they built in there brains.</p>	1		20131021154517	695	1		20131022093237	559	1

I bet that's what your thinking. Well Archeologists are people that studys people or things from the past or you can call it history. but i am going to teach you about finding fort James. the fort was bulit in 1607 when settelers came from england to start a new life. Most belvied that it was bulit near a river&nbsp; the freist object was found in 1861. Archeologists was the name for the people who study people from the past.over 100 years later a grop effort to find the exact spot where the frot was bulit began. The people doing the study used computers mapping software to make an image of the area. that's when they found James Fort!!!!! they found a mark on the ground was the frist thing they found. while they where diging in the trash and the bone of the animal&nbsp; that they ate. they say that it is exciting to find things about history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this pragh I will stell you a little bit about George washington's past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people use to live on the land known as ferry farm for over 12,000 year's. George washinton's father moved his family to the ferry when George was only six year's old at the time. It is 35 people on the team the frist team maps out with 3D computer under ground. Ti is a lot of work in being an archeologists. You have to coraperate with the team to get things done. even if you are not there friend. Thing's are really hard for them but it will be even harder if you are not very intersted in it then I will only have to words for you good luck. what it means to discovery of washington's home is importan for many reasons.I will give you two reason 1 it give citizen a better understanding of who he his. 2 you get to know whay he did what he did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACT'S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Things they use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pick and shovel</p> <p>wisk and dustpan</p> <p>knife</p> <p>weelbarrow</p> <p>skim shovel</p> <p>&nbsp; trowel</p>	0		20131021095614	927	0		20131021191743	551	0

We wouldn't have awesome people in our lives to find artifacts and stuff from amazing people that died. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also did another thing that was very important. They dug up George Washington's Past. Not litterally, but they found amazing artifacts and stuff from George Washington's childhood. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thankyou for reading my essay about archeologists.

What they do and how they do it.</p> <p>&nbsp; First when a group of scientist called archeologist find something to look at and investigate, they have to have the right technology. Like they use computers to determine where they should start looking. Once they find that spot, they have to find there tools.</p> <p>&nbsp; As I just said, they need their tools. These include; a pick and shovel, a brush and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, (which if you were wondering, only picks up a small amount of dirt at a time) and a trowel. These tools are all important to an archeologists job.</p> <p>&nbsp; So there you have it, what an archeologist does and how they do it.

It about they have talk about the history in the past like when they have to talk about finding fort james like a group of people were interested in studing the past started the jamestown Rediscoverery Archaeological Project. So they learned about about finding the fort James &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It also talks about when some people are digging up George Washinton's past (the first president).Like finding the spot, like when people have live on the land called Ferry Farm for 12,000 years . the location makes it a perfect place. And also people knew where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long gone.It also talks about digging up the past, like how the archeogists fing the things in Washington home from years ago. like digging at the ferry farm is a careful place. Some groups of people team up almost like 35 people team up. The first group use 3d competers to track what is under ground. The other group focuses on the actual digging. <br>I also talks about where the author gets the information from.Like some ideas were from http://www.socialsudiesforkids.com and http://wwwlibary.thinkquest.org and http://www.ehow.com and http://www.uwlax.edu.edu and http://www.kenmore.org and http://diganthro.wordpress.com and http://wwwnps.gov and http://historicaljamestowne.org and last but not least httpl://apva.org.

Archeologists are people who study objects from the past. They help people discover objects from the past and what they meant. Archeologists use many sources that help them like the internet, the internet helps them discover more information about the object. There are many reasons why does the job of archeologists are important and you are going to know.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many times archologists work in fossils and when they do they learn many intrusting things just like us, so that means we have something in common with them. Fossils are dead things that were in the past, as time past their shape began going to form a shape on a object. Archeologists wanted to know what happen to the thing and how did it die. Archeologists were smart but sometimes they had trouble discovering the informationn of the thing that was dead, they can even lasted months or years searching about what happen to that thing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists also use many stageties to study the object from the past. Finding Fort James was difficult, for 200 years people thought that the fort had washed away but the archeologists were going to prove them wrong. Most people believed that James Fort was built near the river, the firt object they found was in 1861 it was uncovered armor, weapons, floors, and buildings. Archeologists used mapping software to make an image of the area because they wanted to figure out how the land was used. In that time they found James Fort, the first thing they saw was a set of marks on the ground, the marks showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between the stories the heard and read they knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle with all kinds of things.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acheologists use many hints, tools, and sources. One of the tools are the skim shovels, they used this in digging up a spot that was known as Ferry Farm, people had lived on this land over 12,000 years. Augustine Washington lived there when George Washington was just six years old. No one knew where was the Washington home wqas located since the actual building was long gone. Archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there, they started digging in 2003, it took over a year but they finally found it. The first buildings they found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses, they found the main farmhouse a few days later. Records show that the Washington had a fire in their house.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, archeologists use many tools for many things. Pick and shovel are one of those tools, most digs start with these tools, they used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. The whisk and duskpan used to brush dirt off the asrtifact and clear away dirt fro m the excavation site. A knife is used for careful digging and to scape dirt from around the artifact. The wheelbarrow used to move items big or small from one p[lace to another. Finally a trowel is a common tool of acheology, it used to scrape and cut to view the diffrent layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know a few reasons about why the job of the acheologists is important. Archeologists do a lot of important discoveries and I thank them for helping us discover items that are from the past. Doing this report about acheologists job was important to me and I hope you like it. Acheologists are the best and smart for discoveries.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021130918	535	1		20131021153041	516	1		20131022141556	533	2

You get to look at wonderful things, see thing that you have never seen before and use things that you've never used before. You get to see the remains of a very famous person that lived long ago. You also get to see what they ate and what they lived in and also where they lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get involved with Ferry Farm. The George Washington club runs summer workshops and outdoor activities. Kids can explore the site and discover what its like to be in the Colonial Life. You can become a junior archeologist. Kids can sign up for day classes, games and crafts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994 a group of people interested in the study of the past started the <u>Jamestown Rediscovery</u><u> Archaeological Project.</u></p> <p>The project was designed to descover the secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. For over 200 yrs., people thought that the fort had been washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might still be around there.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The fort was built in 1607 when some settlers came from England to start a new life upon them. Most belived that James Fort was built near the river. It was easier to dock the ships there. So it made sense that the settlers would have chosen that spot. However, objects found nearby suggested the fort was built further up river.&nbsp; The new spot probably gave thee settlers more cover from the enemy ships.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today a group has found about 1 million items a year. Like pottery tools, old coins, and even metal toys they used for children.&nbsp; In the 1600's people used a well or a big pit that was unused to throw away their trash. While digging in the area, an archeologist found the trash the settlers threw away like, bones of animals they ate. The information learned about these objects help us know how the Jamestown people lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021145002	927	1		20131021152621	926	2		20131022093103	533	2

First a archeologist uses a pick and shovel to dig or open the ground a little bit, so the rest of the team can get into it to find something. Then they use the wisk and dust pan to move the dirt out of surrten spots. After all of that, they can finally start using the knife. Ok to get this straight they'll use the knife to pick away at the bone or anything they find really.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we can move on to something a little differen't. The team usually has someone to carry a wheelbarrow to move all the that they don't need away. Next they use they skim shovel to dig a little deeper into the ground, but, here's the cool thing, the skim shovel doesn't just dig it also skims they very top of the mud, dirt, or anything the archeologist don't need that's in theirv way. Last but not least is the trowel. They use the trowel to just nearly skim the top of the soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist do alot of differen't things to help us find out more about our history.</p>	0		20131021155031	547	2		20131022103455	551	1		20131023080107	509	0

Many archaeologist don't find a lot of thing but sometimes they do.They don't find valuable things but they do it so they find artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some archaeologist get very famous some don't. Some find dinosaur bones some don't. Some archaeologist can be in the lab researching the bones and taking DNA samples off of it.They found Jamestown in 1966. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools that they use are special too.They use screens to find artifacts. George Washington house burn down and they didn't have any trace of it. Jamestown Fort was near a river.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They built it right there so it would be easier to get shipments in. Jamestown Fort also had a trash hole.

He lived with his mom and dad when he was a boy.It was four other houses on that farm.It takes two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot hole.They used paint brushes too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that Archaeologist are very important people to this world.If it wasn't for Archaeologist we wouldn't have historical sites and museums.like Jamestown archaeologist are still working on it.Also George Washington home is now a summer camp.That is why i think that archaeologist are very important people.</p>	2		20131021144051	925	1		20131021182726	542	1		20131022163015	533	2

In 1994, a group of people were interested in studying the past about Jamestown. For over 200 years, people thought that James Fort was washed away by a river.

An archeologists job is more than just digging. It is the fun of finding new things, it is the credit of a discovered lost artifact, and it is of course, the joy of, digging. An archeologist is a person who digs up and discovers old artifacts from the past. Of course, they cant do it all alone. The Archeologists takes in a team of up to about 35. Together, they use a variety of tools to <b>dig up the &quot;past&quot;</b>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the tools they use are, the pick and shovel, the classic tool to break away rock and dirt, a whisk and dustpan, used to brush off dust from artifacts, a knife, used to carefully dig and remove dirt, a wheelbarrow, used to move items away or into the excavation pit, a skim shovel, used toremove soil, amd of course, the trovel, a common tool used to clear away different layers of soil. Using these tools alows archeologists to dig for artifacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just being a good worker with tools and artifacts doesn't mean that you can be a good archeologist yet, you must have lots and lots of patience. A full excavation may take many many months to many years. An archeologist must also be good with artifacts all the same. To become an archeologist, you must have these traits and more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry if you think being an archeologist might be boring. There are many interesting parts to being an archeologists that may be exciting. Discovering a rare atifact might be very interesting. &quot;I found George Washington's old kitchen pot!&quot; Things like that could happen to you.

Have you ever wanted to become an archeologist? An archeologist is someone who tries to discover artifacts to help us understand more about history. An archeologist has to have a craving for finding something new, but also has to be patient and go through all the steps you have to do to clean the artifact. Well, I am going to tell you the pleasures and the frustrations of being an archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The pleasures of being an archeologist is that you get to be breathing fresh air outdoors. This job would be great for people who love the outdoors. You must have a feeling inside of you that you need to find something new, to discover. You also get the chance to find something nobody has ever found before. Also if you found something people have been searching for years you can become earn a lot of money, or even be famous! You also have to have patience. So if you are a person who takes there time and does not like being rushed this is the job for you because you can take your time brushing dirt off and making everything look not dirty, then you will fine. If you have all these qualities ad are enthusiastic about this job you can sign up now!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The frustrations about being an archeologist is that sometimes searching for artifacts can take years. Also if you try to hurry the artifact can break and you can get upset with themselves. Another reason is that if you have no patience this is not a good job for you. There are very few reasons that archeologists are bad jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As archeologists you have an important job of informing the public and discovering new thing. Over all in my opinion archeologists are important jobs.</p>	1		20131021153014	542	1		20131021191016	559	1		20131021224141	509	1

But for some people, this job will not fit them well, like me. What if you are spending 5 hours searching for artifacts about Abraham Lincon, and you don't find anything. I don't have any of that patience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people may be wondering what an archeologist is. Well, I'll tell you. An archeologist is a scientist that searches and digs up to find information about a persons past. Archeologists dig up as many things as they can. If they don't find anything the first day, they'll continue the next day either in a new spot, or a little farther away from the old spot they started on.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several different teams to dig up these artifacts. The first team maps the area using 3D computers so they can track what is underground before they dig, so they know what they are digging for. another team focuses on the actual digging. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skin shovels. These shovels are meant to remove thin layers of dirt at once. Then, the dirt is placed in a box with a screen at the bottom so the dirt falls and the artifacts stay in the box. The archeologists then use paint brushes and pick to remove all the dirt from the artifact. Another team spends days and days studying what these artifacts are, what they mean, and what they are used for.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists can find so many things even if they were from last week, or 1 million years ago. But what are the tools that they use to dig up these items from 1 million years ago? well, do not worry, i will tell you. Archeologists use many items to help them find these items. They use picks and shovels to dig into the rocks or soil. The whisk and the dustpan are used to brush dirt off of the artifacts. They also use the knife to carefully scrape off the dirt around the artifacts. The wheelbarrow is used to transport items from one place to another. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The trowel is probably the most popular tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut soil to view different layers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know what archeologists usually look for? They usually look for ancient artifacts from the past. If an archeologist is looking for information about Abraham Lincon's childhood, he would most likely start at his house to look for toys he played with, what his mom or dad used to cook him food, and other items like that. Then, they would move on to where he was starting to become a grown man. There, they would look for things he used for his job. Finally, the archeologist would probably look at his home at the time when he was married.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you van see, being an archeologist has its ups and downs, but I think being an archeologist would be out of my reach. This is just my opinion at age 11, mabye at age 16, I might change my mind. Would you want to be an archeologist?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022134915	560	2		20131022141311	696	2		20131023210705	509	2

They do many things such as, find artifacts that fill in gaps and questions in history. They also discover things from the past they nobody did know. The artifacts archeologists find are very important, we too can also learn from the artifacts they can find. We can learn something from each artifact they find, we can about things like, where James Fort was or what weapons Indians used in the pasts. Those are very important things we can learn from artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists use many tools to dig up artifacts too. They use important tools like a trowel, skim shovel, a wheel barrow and much much more. These tools are very important, they each do an important job to the artifact. For example a whisk and dustpan, the whisk and dustpan sweep off dirt off the artifact and the dustpan collects the dirt and they also clear away dirt from an excavation site. Even though they are very small tools they are very important.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Even though archeologists wait a long time to find an artifact it is worth it. These steps to find an artifact seem pretty simple but they take a lot of time and its harder than you think. These steps are what I believe they do.The First step is to find the spot where you think the artifact is, But you have to find clues to know you are in the exact spot. The next step is a team of people maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. That information is recorded so the ones finding the artifact can know what it looks like before they start digging. After that step They start digging, they dig carefully so when they are digging they won't break the artifact. Then once they find the artifact they carefully grab it and clean it off with specific tools. Once they are done they report back to the team. These steps take a long time but it is worth the wait.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In my opinion I think that the job of an archeologists is really interesting. I think the job of an archeologist's interesting because digging up artifacts seems very fun. And there's a lot of suspense whether you found or not. But personally I wouldn't want to become an archeologist because I am not very patient and I just want to find things immediately. Even though it seems really fun digging up artifacts and things I wouldn't want to do it myself. I can't believe the archeologists have enough patience to wait and wait till they find something. Their job is very amazing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall archeologists work is very amazing. They work very hard just to find one artifact or more. They have very important jobs. I'm glad we have archeologists in the world because without them we wouldn't know anything in history or back then.&nbsp; I am very glad we have archeologists in this world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021173823	223	2		20131022100410	535	2

So today, I will talk about archeologist.When you are archeologist, you need to have a team. For digging and founding. For example, 35 people. And you need to know where you need to digging. Then, you need to use 3D computer, why?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Because you need to know where the object you are trying to find it. If you knew where it is, you can start digging, but there's two way to digging, first, you can just digging with skim shovels. Skim shovels are sharp, flat, and small.</p> <p>Second, this way called &quot;Troweling&quot;. When you're troweling, you need to have small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square foot section.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So this way is better to do when the object is small or it's not so strong. Archeologist is usually digging for find more history. For example: They found the James fort and found canons and armors. Also they know the ledges were designed to hold canons. Also in 2003, the archeologist found the our first president, George Washington's home. First they found the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Then they found the main farmhouse a few years later.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You see, job of archeologist are very important, because we can know how George Washington lived when he was a boy. And we can know how he became famous. So I think the archeologists are cool and important in USA.</p>	1		20131018150518	559	0		20131018191205	551	0		20131018210331	509	1

Not everyone knows what an archeologist is or what they do, but they are still very significant. Archeologists are people who study history. They are significant in many different, but similar in some ways . For example, we need scientists to discover earths history and teach it to todays people so no one is confused on what happened and why it happened.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have been known for their important studies, because of history happening since the first day of earth archeologists have been at it for decades maybe even centuries. They're known for discovering non-living things to living things and exinct things to fossels. In the past life time, scientists didn't have the technology that we have today so they couldn't find that much evidence on what happened before. However, todays technology is more advanced in many ways which provides acheologists to go deeper into their thoughts and reasons. Although, its still hard to be an archeologist because history is told through man to man and some stories are told differently which could lead to false imformation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have used technology and hand tools to dig up the finest and fairest information. The tools they use depand on the history they are trying to descover. For example, you would have to use a trowel to scrape and cut to veiw different layers of soil, a smim shovel which has a flat edge used to carefully remover a thin layer of soil which each scoop, a wheelnbarrow to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt or heavy objects away from an excavation site, a knife used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around artifacts, a whivl and dustpan used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site, and finally a pck and shavel because most digs start with these two tools they're used to dig into the earth close to the artifacts. Those tools are some of the tools you would use if your trying to find history from when exinct or dead living things or to find the history and information from a fossel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, archeologists are scientists that discover earths history and pass it down to people, they use many technology and tools to dig up the evidence of what happened, why it happened, and how it happened. They are very significant scientists and they help provide information to teach others of the past. Archeologists have been around for centuries telling man to man about recent and past times. Todays archeologists are more fortunate because they have more advanced technology to study more and more about the past. Therefore, archeologist will continue gathering information and facts about history and pass stories down, there will probably be no ending to this.</p>	2		20131021141345	555	2		20131021180538	695	2

It helps us understand more about the past by providing us with artifacts of the DNA of someone such as a piece of hair. Archeologists provide us with some of the most important items ever like dinosaur bones and Abraham Lincoln's hat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The first step to an archeologists job is to map out the area of where they are digging with a 3-D computer. The computer will show them how the land looked before they started digging and it will also show them what is in the ground that they can excavate. Since you need a lot of people to dig there are 35 people to a team of archeologists. Team one is the most important because they map out the area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The second step is to start digging where you think the artifacts are if your lucky you'll find some. this is a very important step because it lets you get the artifacts. Artifacts can range in all different sizes and different rarities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third step is 2 trowel the dirt, you trowel by saking it in a pan with little holes in it. Throweling lets you find the small artifacts that you might have not seen. Troweling also takes skill because if you shake to fast an artifact could break or fall out of it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without archeologists we would have trouble finding about the past.</p>	2		20131021155448	555	2		20131022094959	223	2

Well some stuff they used was simple like a wheelbarrow, whisk and dust pan, and a shovel. But some things wer more complicated like a skim shovel, and trowel. A skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil at a time with each scoop. A trowel is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.

The knife was used for scraping dirt from around. they used a wheelbarrow to move items from one place to another but mostly dirt is moved. Now the skim shovel its a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Last but not least the trowel it is a common tool they use.

Many people thought that it had been washed down the river it was made close by too, or destroyed and too broken to try and find. Around 200 years later there were signs that those theories were wrong and that James Fort was still there. The Jamestown Archaeological Project groups were determined to find more about this fort and prove the theories wrong.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason why they are so determined is in 1861 the first objects were found, armor and weapons to protect the fort, they also found they also found the floor of the fort. They didn't stop and around 100 years later, they found the exact spot where James Fort stood and stayed strong enough to find now. A 5 year study was worth it! It took computer mapping software and hard work to find the wall marks and stone ledges over the river it was built by. This showed that canons used to be there and also found cellars, burial sites, and ten buildings. They found even more things and each year even more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly this shows that the Jamestown Archaeological Project proved the theories about Fort James destroyed and washed down the river wrong! They had found the cellars, buildings, artifacts, and marks where the fort had been. Team-work and determination really helps. It took years and years to have this project come through very successful and now we all can know much more about James Fort than we did.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, determination and believing that you are right pays through. The Jamestown Archaeological Project groups should be proud of them selves for believing and being determined in what they believe and what they have done for their country. We today know much more about the James Fort than what we did a couple hundred years ago, just because of one group determined and believing in them self ready to discover what they want. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021134916	223		N	20131021143730	926	2		20131022153312	533	1

Archeologists have a difficult, but rewarding job in</p> <p>which they find ancient artifacts. They use many different tools, and use them to find different things. They have to go through different steps in order to find what they are searching for. These are the ways archeologists dig up history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists first map the ground where they will dig. They use 3D computers to track things in the</p> <p>ground. The image that comes out is the map of the area. They then record all that information, so the diggers know what it is like in that area. The mappers have an easier job than the diggers, though.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br> The archeologists that dig do it in the place called the dig. They use tools such as a knife, pick, shovel,</p> <p>trowel, skim shovel, whisk, dustpan, and wheelbarrow. The tools are each used for different reasons. The diggers first start digging with their skim shovels, which remove thin layers of soil at a time. The dirt scooped is put in a box with a small screen at the bottom, letting dirt fall, but keeping artifacts in. Archeologists also use their trowels in a process called troweling. That is when they use small shovels, picks, and brushes to take away soil and dirt. The digging part of archeology is undoubtedly the hardest.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The final step in archeology is studying them. Another team of archeologists spend days studying the</p> <p>artifacts found. The people who study the artifacts find information about the past. They can find out how people lived, or use the artifacts to find a specific place. Studying the objects is probably fun, since you can find information about history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you see, archeology is a hard job that many people rely on to find historic things. The artifacts</p> <p>archeologists find are useful in finding information about history. Without archeology, what would we know about history?</p>	2		20131021144409	516	2		20131021201657	551	2

An archeologist is a person who goes to find some thing that is very old using all kinds of resources.<br> For instance, if you are trying to find something that belonged to the vikings, then you would have to go to where the vikings lived Archeologists go through difficulty, hard thinking, and pride while working. Archeologists go through a lot to find these wonderful things and without them, we wouldn't know much of our history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; To start, an archeologist's job is difficult because a lot of things that they are looking for are very fragile. They need to use special tools and be very careful because of these fragile pieces. It is also difficult because if they mess up one thing, then all the blame would be on them because they just ruined history. Lastly, it is difficult because most of the time it takes a very long time to find out what they are searching for.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Initially, being an archeologist takes a lot of thinking because before you even start searching for what you want to find. For instance, if you wanted to find something that belonged to the vikings you would have to do a lot of research and studying before you start looking. They also have to do a lot of thinking because they need to know what they are doing. If they do the wrong thing and they mess up, then everything will get ruined.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, one of the most exhilarating part in an archeologist's job is feeling pride. They probably get this feeling when they finally discovered what they were searching for. For example, if you finally found where George washington lives, then you would feel it because you finally found your discovery. They would also feel pride because most of the time, it takes them a long time to find there discovery and usually, when you've been working on something for a long time and you finally finish it, you feel pride.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To conclude, archeologists are very important to us. they put a lot of time and effort just to find history for us. Archeologists have very stressful jobs, but they always manage to get their jobs done. They are also fantastic role models on us and are a big part of our education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022110641	554	2		20131022114908	547	2		20131023094056	560	2

Archeologists are people who &quot;dig up the past&quot;. There are many archeologists all over the world, and they all do different things. For example, some dig up fossils of dinosaurs to discover about when they lived and etc. while others study artifacts that date back to 1300 B.C. The phrase &quot;digging up the past&quot; was made because archeologists had been digging for facts about the past through artifacts and other. Many of the pottery pieces, statues, and pieces of statues in museums came from the work of archeologists across the globe. Archeologist's jobs are to find clues about the past.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now a days, some of the tools used by the archeologists are picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. Even though we are in the 21 century, they still use these basic tools. Along with this, current day archeologists use 3 dimensional computers to scan the ground for remains and they use other technology too. We are lucky to have modern day technology to help us in many things. Archeologists can take less time, energy, and money using these tools because then they don't dig up the wrong areas. Some of the tools archeologists use have special jobs. For example, a pick and a shovel: used to dig into the earth, can cart away dirt. A whisk and dustpan can be used to: brush away dirt and uncover artifacts/ clear away dirt from search site. Knives are useful to do careful digging around artifacts and to scrape dirt away. A skim shovel is useful because you can take thin layers of dirt off. One of the more common tools throughout the world is the trowel: used to scrape and cut into the soil. There are many tools, modern and classic, used in the study of archeology.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the years, archeologists have discovered many interesting things. For instance, some archeologists are currently on a search for an ancient Mongolian king's, Ganges Kan,<b><b> tomb</b></b>. Others searched for George Washington's house. All studies took at least 2 years. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be an archeologist. Years if work may result to nothing. Many, though, believe it is a good job because you get discover the past. One article I read was called <b>Finding Fort James</b>. Fort James was part of the Revolutionary War and settlement of America. Early settlers lived there so after 200 years, in which people believed it was washed away by the river, the National Park Service asked some archeologists to go looking for traces of Fort James. It took 5 years, but finally they found the triangular structure stretching from the river, back into the mainland property. Many other searches have been issued to find facts about people of the past, how they lived, and etc.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, many studies have taken place throughout the years to find facts about the past and there have been many archeologists.

In 1607, when settlers came from England to start a new life, most believed that James Fort was built near the river. The first objects were found in 1861 by scientists who study objects form the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, archeologists tried to dig up George Washington's past. Since no one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was long ago, the archeologists decided to try find the house. They started digging for the Washington house in 2003. Though it took over a year, they finally managed to find it. The first buildings found were the kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. They actually fond the main house a few years later.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the tools that they used were a pick and shovel that start the digging and close to the artifacts. Secondly, archeologists also use a knife which is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. To continue, these scientists use tool called a trowel which is the most common tool for a acrheologist to use. They are used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Fourth, archeologists use a wheelbarow to move items form one place to the next or to carry dirt away from the area. Fifth, they use a skim shovel to remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. Finally, archeolgists use a whisk and a dustpan to brush off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the tools that most archeologists mainly use to dig an find the valuables of fomous people and places that know one knowa anythein about.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131018144407	516		N	20131018152007	695		N

Archeologists are people that dig and find all the things you see in museums. I bet you don't believe me but it is true. They also find a ton of cool things! For example; some archeologists find bones, jewelry, gems, and other cool things. Some archaeologists even find hidden cites, old Indian camps that haven't been used for years, even George Washington's own house! Some even find dinisor bones, tracks they made, old nests, petrified eggs that never got to hatch, and more! I wish I were an archeologist because of all the cool tools they use&nbsp; and amazing things they find.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the tools they use they use are, a pick and a shovel to start digging away to get rid of the harder dirt, and a wheelbarrow to carry away all the dirt. They also use a whisk and a dustpan to take off dirt on the artifacts and to get rid of the dirt on the excavation site. There are many other tools to such as a knife for careful digging, skim shovel to remove a thin layer of dirt, a trowel to also do very careful digging and lastly, ( my favorite ) a 3D computer to see things underground. Isn't it sooo cool?

They even found the house that George Washington lived in and James Fort! They found many things that will help us understand more about the past. They found burned pottery, clay pipes and kitchen utencials at George Washington's house. Along with armor, weapons, gold coins, stone ledges, metal toys for children, and food scraps from James Fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning about things like this is fun ( to most people ) and also educational.

It was a ruby red diamond.The diamond was glaring through my bedroom window.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went up too that guy and asked him if I could have it, he said probbably not son, and I said Oww shoot. Man how much do you think it is worth. He said I don't know $102.00 would that work sure son thanks.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough someone else found something it was also shiny my mom said I walked out and seen it , it was a huge nugget of gold. It weighed five LBs. I asked him if I could have it he said no this time but the next time I could no matter what.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dugg for three hours and fifteen minutes.Finally he found a cryistal,flat piece of silver, and a gold nugget. He said he can't get nothing out of the silver or cryistal so he just gave it to me.

In 1994 a bunch of people interested in the past created the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. This project was made to find old secrets of the James Fort in Jamestown,Virginia. For Over 200 years, some people thought the James Fort was washed away by a river. Some discoveries in the area hinted that it might be still there in Jamestown,Virginia. The James Fort was built in 1607 when new people came to the 13 colonies to start a new life. Many people thought that the James Fort was built near a river. It was built there so it will we easier to dock their ships there so it made sense that the people would chose that spot to dock. The objects found nearby suggested to move the fort to move farther. The new spot that the settlers found was more protected from enemy ships.In conclusion 1994 was when the start of the James Town Rediscovery Archaeological Project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; In 1861 archeologists found the first objects. Archeologists discover armor and weapons and they also discover the floor of the James Fort. Over 100 years later people tried to find the location of the James Fort again. The National Park Service led a five year study of the area to try to find how the land was used. They new that that it would help to find the location of the James Fort. The people doing the studying used a computer mapping software to imagine how the area would look like.They finally found the location they found marks on the ground the marks where the fort's wall.The archeologists thought the shape of the fort was a triangle but it was really stretched all away a crossed the river.&nbsp; In conclusion found objects that lead them to find the location of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that archeologists study was George Washington. People have lived on the land called Ferry Farm for over 12,000 .It makes a perfect location to built a a house. That's why it is not surprising that George Washington's father moved his family there.When his dad moved him to Ferry Farm George was only 6 years old!No one really knew were was his home located since the actual building was no longer there. However archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. The archeologists started to dig in 2003.It took them over a year, but they finally found the stone base.The first thing the archeologists found was the kitchen,slave quarters, and the storage houses.After a few years later they found a farmhouse.In conclusion George Washington lived in Ferry Farm</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last the four houses have been built on Ferry Farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof why this was George Washington farmland.Records show that Washington had a fire in their house. The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery. This suggests a fire occurred in his house.They also found a part of clay pipe. We know that Washington smoked clay pipes, so this gave more proof this was George Washington's house.In conclusion the archeologists found 4 houses and they think one of them is Washingtonians</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131022131148	554		N	20131022131814	934		N

Archeologists need to be careful about some tools and need some pacents so the jo can get done with having to hear are we done yet they can&nbsp; hurt them selfs and they what will happin if one person hurts the self and they are alone then what can you do after you hurt themself then you have no water to clear the cut.

The archeologist went to the spot where Washington's house used to be to look for artifacts. It took a year to find the spot but they did. The archeologist used many tools to find artifacts. They started digging with a skim shovel that can dig layer by layer in the ground.

Maybe you've heard of people that dig up dinosaur bones?</p> <p>Those people are archaeologists. Many Archaeologists dig up old artifacts or small pieces of things hundreds, and maybe thousands of years old. There are archeologists all over the world. There are archeologists in China, Canada, Australia, Russia, Kenya, France, and here in the U.S.A. There are archeologists many other places, too.</p> <p>Tools they use are pickaxes, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels,</p> <p>and trowels. Everything is used for something different. I bet you were wondering what a trowel was, or the difference between a skim shovel and a regular shovel. Well, I'm about to tell you.</p> <p><u><b><b>Pick and shovel</b></b></u></p> <p>Pickaxes and shovels are used to break and dig up dirt near the spot where the artifacts are.</p> <p>Most digs start with these two tools. Picks are used to break up dirt and make the easier for the shovel. Shovels are used to dig dirt up to make the artifacts easier to get to.</p> <p><u><b><b>Whisk and dustpan</b></b></u></p> <p>These tools are used to brush dirt off of artifacts. They can also be used to brush dirt away <b>very</b></p> <p>close to the artifact, so the archaeologist won't damage the artifact.</p> <p><u><b><b>Knife</b></b></u></p> <p>Knives are used to scrape dirt away from the edge of the artifact. They can be used&nbsp; to scrape</p> <p>dirt from the insides of artifacts.</p> <p><u><b><b>Wheelbarrow</b></b></u></p> <p>Wheelbarrows are used to haul dirt away from the dig site. They can also carry heavy artifacts</p> <p>away from the dig site.</p> <p><b><u><b>Skim Shovel</b></u></b></p> <p>This tool is used to dig layer by layer of soil from the dig site, and is mostly used when close</p> <p>to the artifact.</p> <p><u><b><b>Trowel</b></b></u></p> <p>The most common tool used.

The tools they use, where they discover the past, and digging!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have you heard about those people that are discovering new things? They are archeologist! Archeologist use many tools to find interesting things. Some of the tools they use are a Pick and Shovel, Whisk and Dustpan, Knife, Wheelbarrow, Skim Shovel, and Trowel. The pick and shovel are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Now those two are really needed! The whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. Boy, those are two&nbsp; things you will miss if you forgot them at home! Careful digging and scrapping dirt from around the artifacts is easier if you have a knife. Moving items from one place to another isn't easy&nbsp;without a wheelbarrow! Wheelbarrows are also used to carry dirt away from the excavation site. A skim shovel is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. The TROWEL is the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. If this one is not in your back pocket, you probably won't be finding anything!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For archeologist to find things they have to find the spot first.</p> <p>Finding the spot isn't easy, you have to search and search and search.&nbsp; Another thing that you have to do is to calculate where (for example) George Washington lived and where he would go, etc.&nbsp; You would have to figure all that out then go there and find it.</p> <p>&nbsp; It doesn't sound so easy, but it is quite enjoyable!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging is a BIG part in archeology. Digging isn't that easy, it's not supposed to be, but digging can be the best part if you think about it. The digging leads you to the end and the suprise is waiting there!&nbsp; Also you have a team of up to 35 people so that makes it a lot better! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Skim Shovels are used for when you dig. The whole digging process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see archeology is a big job! You have a lot of work to get done and that work is very important! It is an enjoyable, good experience job too! You have to work hard and get dirty but that's where all the fun comes from! The past is always fun to find in the present to show the future!&nbsp;So you should try archeology as your job in the future, I might even consider it!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	2		20131021153641	559	2		20131021192926	563	2

Those scientists are called archeologists and they study objects from a long time ago. They collect the data, find the artifacts, and use different tools to do it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists need a place to start so they can conduct the investigation. That's where the data comes in. They use other scientist's research to know where to find what they are looking for. After they know where to look, they have to create data of their own to help other scientists. If they want to figure something out they have to find the problem and use their knowledge to research it. Collecting data is a giant part of how they discover information.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After collecting all their data, scientists can look for the artifacts. This is important because actually seeing the objects makes it easier to study them. Archeologists look for artifacts where they know they can find them. But why do they look in the first place? This question is very easy to answer. Archeologists look for artifacts to find out more about the lives of people who lived before us and to advance in areas where other people needed help. Scientists also look for artifacts to find how things came to be. Documents are artifacts that we couldn't do without. If we did not have a documentation of how things happened it would be much harder to study the way things worked. Artifacts play an extremely important role in the study of history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do scientists get these things like data and artifacts? They use tools of course! Not just any tools though. They use specific tools to do specific jobs. Some of these tools are shovels and picks which help the scientists clear out land that they need to move in order to find their artifacts. No scientist could get this job done if they did not have the right tools to do it. Archeologists use whisks to wipe the dirt off of their artifacts and to collect small samples of their discoveries. They can even use knives to do things like scraping dirt off of important objects. These are only a few things that archeologists use for their investigations. Tools are another example of something very important to discovering information.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists and historians know what happened in the past for all of these reasons and some more. Archeologists certainly have to collect their data, find their artifacts, and last but not least, use all kinds of special tools.</p>	2		20131022130526	535	2		20131022135259	560	2		20131024074833	509	2

They get to find artifacts, fossils, and other neat things. Archeologists learn new things every day and can discover old artifacts from long ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing archeologists do is get all the supplies they need. The supplies that they need include, a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. A pick and a shovel is used for digging in the earth, a whisk and dustpan is used for brushing dirt off artifacts, a knife is used for scraping dirt from around artifacts, a wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another, a skim shovel is used for removing a thin layer of soil in each scoop, and a trowel is used for scraping and cutting to view the different layers of soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Next, archeologists need to find a place to work. They would need a place with a lot of artifacts or somewhere that had a village or house that isn't there anymore. Somewhere like Fort James, Virginia would work. Fort James was built in 1607 so there is lots of artifacts there. Places like this would be perfect for archeologists to dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, archeologists would start digging for artifacts. They look for parts of houses, floors of buildings, armor or weapons, cellars, or anything old. They would use a trowel, a skim shovel, and a pick and shovel to dig. Then the archeologists bring the items they find to a certain spot in a wheelbarrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, the archeologists get the whisk and dustpan, knife, and start to clean up the artifacts they found. once they do that they start studying them and find the history of&nbsp; what they found.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, being an archeologist is an exciting job and one day you might decide to be one too!</p>	2		20131018145212	927	2		20131018153436	546	2

They traval all around the world to find all of the fossles. They also study the soil. They use a skim shovel to dig up a hole layer of soil, and they use a trowel to scrape and cut tho soil to view the different layers.

He was in the Revolutionary War. He was the genral of the Patriots, his solders wore blue coats and the British wore red coats, the British name was the Regulars. The Patriots were harder to find because the Regulars were bright colered so it was very easy to find them. People don't realy know about Washington's as a child but people are starting to find out a little bit about it. Goerge Washington also had wooden teeth. When he was about 6 years old his family built a farmhouse. A few years later there was a fire in the farmhouse.</p>	1		20131018155342	533	0		20131021085239	695	2		20131021160557	560	1

The things you see in the museum are somethings they got from archeologist that found that item undergound because you can tell by the dirt and the dust around it. Archeologist use items like whisk and a dustpan or a melterdetecter to find the item or a wheelbarrow to move the item or to move dirt out the way.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Being a archeologist is interesting because you can find things from the past or find something that belongs to a famous person that past away. Archeologist also found out secrets about James Fort in Jamestown, virginia and that over 200 years many people say that the fort was washed away by a river. Discoveries has been hinted that the fort is still around. The fort was all built in 1607 when people from england came to start a new life. Many believed that the fort was built next to a river because it was easy to dock ships there.Archeologist uncovered armor and weapons, they also discovered the floors of some buildings too. The National Park Service led a five-year to study the area to figure out how the land was used and what types of buildings where there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologist also found secrets about George Washington's past. George Washinton's father, Augutine Washinton, moved his family to Ferry Farm. People lived in Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. Its a perfect place to built a home. No one knows where the Washinton home is located. Archeologists believed the stone base under the home is still there. Four more houses have been built there.

The process of digging in places is a careful one.Each year many teams will work on a famous place.The way the archeologists dig up these atifacts is with having&nbsp; groups work on different things like let's say the first group maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground.The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small,flat and sharp that they can remove nothing but thin layers of soil,one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch&nbsp; screen at the bottom. This let's the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Trowling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a place that is 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. So that's how the whole process is made and hoe the job is done and hoe thw archeologists do their job.</p>	N		20131022131431	927		N	20131022140954	551		N

A archeologists is all about the pick, shovel, whisk, dustpan, knife, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and the trowel. And even some times you can go on there web sites and see there information online. It take alot of time to dig up the past of the peoples history. People like to dig up the pst of famous peoples stuff is because they want to get money for what they found. And also for what they found they want money and fame for thier discovery for what they found. Yes it mit be cool being famous is all about the money and people knowing you and liking you, its about what you did to become and how you did what you did to become famous in the first place. So archeologist just want money or fame for what they found and they want to find they want what they found to be in the musem so everone can see what they have found. people should not do that because they should just have not because its valued because you found it. You should have what you find and be happy about it. That it what an archeologists does for a work or a job or a living.</p>	0		20131021200756	554	1		20131022132429	926	0		20131023085533	509	0

The new spot probably gave the settlers more protectionfrom enemy ships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first objects were found in 1861. Archeologists,the name for scientists who study objects from the past,</p> <p>uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a group effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The National Park Service led a five-year study of the area to figure out how the land was used. They knew that this would help them decidewhere to look for proof of the fort.

The first thing they found was a set of marks on the ground. The marks showed where fort's walls used to be. Between all stories they heard and read, and drawings they made, the archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and found out that the fort streched all the way to the river. Then they realized there were stone ledges built over the river. The ledges were designed to hold canons. The archeologists also found eleven cellers, dozens of burial sites, and ten buildings all within the border of the fort.</p>	N		20131022130433	546		N	20131022143253	563		N

Archeologist still belive there is stone base where his house used to be. They started digging in 2003.It took longer than a year but they found it. The first buildings they found was the kichen, slave quarters, and a storage house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Therewas more houses on the Ferry Farm land they just needed proof that it was George Washingtons farm house. They found burnt pottery that means there was a fire there.they found part of a clay pipe.

Archeologist use a lot of tools.Here are a few tools and other information about Archeologists and how they work.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; They use picks and shovels, which most digs start with these two tools, for digging into the earth close to the artifacts. Next they use a whisk and a dustpan, which is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. They also use knifes for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. They also use wheelbarrows' sometimes for moving items or dirt away from the excavation site. There are several ways to find artifacts, buy using different tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Archeologists were digging they discovered or rediscovered that there were at least four other houses that have been built on the Ferry Farm Land, so the diggers had to find proof that they chose the right one. We know that George Washington smoked clay pipes, so therefore they had proof when they found a part of a clay pipe.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a group of people were studying the past, they had a project and it was designed to find all the secrets of James Fort, Virginia. For over 200 years, people thought that the fort have been washed away by a river. The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life. The first object was found in 1861. Archeologists discovered the floors of buildings. Over 100 years later, a goup effort to find the exact spot where the fort was built began.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of stuff have been found by Archeologists, they have searched for over several years for objects and still are. They work hard searching, using knifes, and whisk all day and night. not many people think that is interesting figuring out hisory and the past of well-known people. Hopefully they enjoy it, because they have to work hard!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022131627	551	1		20131022133553	223	1

It will be talking about thier jobs, the differnt tools used, and how they do it. Archeologists are people that dig up different things and find things that have to do with the history of different things in the world. Archeologists have to have many different responsibilities to do what they do. There are 6 different tools that they use. Archeologists dont always find things every day. Somedays they might be just looking around and other days it might be very sucsessful but they should always have to have a positive attitude about it. Archeologists are very hard workers to get theur job complete for the day but the next day they should still be as positive and hard working as they were the day before.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>First off, about Archaeologists jobs. Archeologists are scientists who study objects fromthe past. They have to be very patienrt otherwise they will not be able to find things. Not everything that Archeologists do is digging some of it is having to go look in old places or look in areas that are hidden but not unerground.&nbsp;<b> </b>There can be up to 35 people on a team. The first team has to map the area and read it on a 3D computer. The information is recorded so that people know where to look to find things. Another team focuses on the actual digging and where they are digging is called a dig. Archeologists have to work together on things cause somethings that they are getting out are very big or delecate so they have to work together to get it out.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, is about the different tools that they use. The different tools that an Archeologists use are a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim and shovel and a trowel. All these tools have a very special meaning and are used for different things. A pick and shovel are the two tools that most people in a dig start with. they are used to dig into the earth, that are close to the artifacts. A whisk and a dustpan are used to brush the dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt form the excavation site. A knife is used for carefully digging out the artifacts and to scrape the dirt away from around the artifacts. Skim shovels are a shovel with a flat edge used top carefully remove a thin layer of soil at a time with each scoop. The last tool is a trowel. A trowel is probably the most common tool in archeology and is used to scrape and cut to veiw the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, about how they do their job. Archeologists are very determine people who walk around loking for bones or old artifacts. They do this because they want to learn more about the history of the world and they would like to share it with the rest of the world. They are not all the time digging but sometimes just looking areound to see what they can find. Archeologists have to be very careful to make sure that they dont brake any of the objects. They have to use the special tools for what they are made to do only or nothing else because if they arer used improperly theycan brake or they can brake the artifacts. They would especially have to work together when they are in a team of 35. Each team has a different role to do to get the job done. One team might be digging while another team could be mapping out the whole area to tell the other team where to look.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion of this passage about Archeology it was talking about theier jobs, the different tools used to do this, and how they do their jobs. I learned that a team of Archeologists can be up to 35 people at a time and that ther are six different tools used.&nbsp; I hope that you learned lots of new things too. If I were to do this again I would do it about a teacher's job. i would do it sbout that because i think that teachers have a very interesting job. Hope you enjoyed learning about Archeologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By: Laila Monda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021090849	547	2		20131021115334	516	1		20131025083750	509	2

It requires patience, determination, and a bit of strength. Archeologist first dig, to find artifacts and other pieces of preserved history. Then they analyze these pieces to identify whose it was, when it as used or made, why it was used or made, and of course, what it is!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists rarely find important things.

The job of an archeologists is to find things or objects that were buried, left, or even hidden over 100 years ago or longer. Archeologists study things like pottery, old jewelry, and a lot of other things. Archeologists discover so many things by researching, digging, and with all the other technology we have know. Archeologists use all the resources they have or need to research something.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, archeologists find nearly one million objects! A group of archeologists wanted to study the past that started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. The project was made to find interesting facts about Jamestown.Archeologists study,work, and search on projects like this. Archeologists use so many sources to study and find objects from a long ago, especially with the equipment that we have know and the equipment we will have in the future.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have to be really careful with the objects they do research on or the objects they find because the object might be really fragile or really delicate. Archeologists uncovered weapons and armor while they were researching over James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. They also discovered the floors of buildings. The first objects that were found by archeologists was in the year 1861. Archeologists found James fort by finding some marks on the ground, drawings they made, and archeologists knew that the fort would be shaped like a triangle. See, archeologists do use all of there resources, they even made maps to find out were the fort would be.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the resources archeologists use are knife, pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, wheelbarrow, skim shovel, and trowel. Archeologists use these equipment to help make there job easier and help them find more objects then they usually do. If we didn't have archeologists in the world, we wouldn't be finding all the interesting things in history or how people looked like over 1 million years ago. We need archeologists so that we can discover so many other things. That's what archeologists do in there jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021135448	559	2		20131021144051	925	2

For History Day I have chosen to write about archeology. Archeology is about helping the people of today learn about the past. There are many tools used in archeology such as the knife and wheelbarrow. People who study archeology are called archeologists. One discovery requires over one hundred archeologists. Archeologists spend years and years digging for things from the past.</p> <p>&nbsp; There are many tools used in archeology, here are some of them, the knife, the wheelbarrow, the trowel, the skim shovel, pickaxes, shovels, whisks, and dustpans. Whisk and dustpans are used to clean artifacts. Wheelbarrows were used to move dirt and artifacts from one place to another. Most archeology digs start with picks and shovels and they are used to dig close to artifacts. The trowel is the most common tool used in archeology and it is used for scraping and cutting dirt. The skim shovel has a flat edge to help carefully remove a thin layer of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp; Now I think archeology is very interesting. Some discoveries such as the finding James Fort and George Washington's house have been very helpful archeology discoveries. Yes you may think archeology is boring but think of all the cool things you could find. You could find dinosaur fossils, gold, a buried ancient civilization, and caves of diamonds! So really archeology isn't very boring at all and I hope you agree with me.</p>	2		20131022084803	547	2		20131022113844	563	2

These amazing discoveries were made by people we call archeologist. I read many different story's and passages on what archeologist do and what they discover throughout their jobs. I found out that their jobs may seem easy to do because people think &quot;Oh how hard could it be to dig a hole?&quot;, but what most children and even some adults don't realize is that you have to be really careful in what you do and how you do it. Also many people don't realize that it's not just digging in the first passage that I read the author put in this sentence &quot;The National Park Service led a five-year study of the Jamestown area to figure out how the land was used.&quot; Now just think if it took five years to discover things about the land and over a hundred years to find that land do you think they took their time?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The great American discovery!</u></p> <p>&nbsp; Amazingly enough things are still being discovered whether it's old fossils, broken pottery, or even a historical land mark like George Washington's old house! Yes, we are on the verge of finding George Washington's childhood home. The archeologists believe that they have already discovered the Washington's home but are not sure. They have pretty stable evidence of it being the right house for example they found pieces of burnt pottery and we know that the Washington's went through a fire. They also found a piece of clay pipe which they believe belongs to our great President himself since it has been recorded that he smoked clay pipes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Tools!</u></p> <p>Archeologists use an abundance of tools.

Archeologist go out and about to historical places to look for artifacts. They use different tools to look for artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each historical place requires special tools such as a Whisk and Dustpan, a Pick and a Shovel, etc. etc. the Archeologist will use these tools to uncover the artifacts. Then after the person who digs digs a different person looks at the artifact. Many people are evolved.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like when you find a arrowhead in the dirt you are doing what an Archeologist does every day for a living. Sometimes when you are working in a garden you find an old piece of pottery or a handle of a mug Archeologist look in old Battle Forts and old abandon town's to look for those kinds of artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the next time you find a piece of old pottery or a arrowhead think of an archeologist.Is an Archeologist what you want to be when you grow up kids?</p>	1		20131021102917	547	1		20131021111850	555	2		20131021224141	509	1

They need a whisk and a dustpan to clear up any objects like a fossil. They need a skim shovel too, so that they can dig up any thick layer of dirt. Archeologists, even need a trowel, knife, and a wheelbarrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists are people who discover the things from the past. They may or may not discover how old they are or from what place was it from. Archeologists sometimes find things that are more than&nbsp; one million dollars. Many archeologists find fossils. Acheologists get lots of money for finding gigantic things like dinosaur bones.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists need tools because if they use their hands and feet it might take a whole year. Archeologists are important to us beause they help us find things that we don't have time for. They even get us, kids, interested in history. Not only do we get interested in history we might even want a job like that. Many people thank archeologists for what they have found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists work a lot which I'm sure no kid would want to do a lot of work. Kids usually would think that it could be easy working a job like this. There are mostly men who work as archeologists. I've never seen or heard about a woman be an archeologist. Usually there are books about archeologists.</p>	1		20131021192522	563	2		20131022143742	934	1		20131023081434	509	1

Sometimes there is not enough information to be exact so it takes years to get the information.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing that archeologists studied is about George Washington. They do not know much him as a child but it is changing. They are finding out more and more about him. Archeologists do know about where he lived though. George Washington's father moved to Farm Ferry when George was only six. They don't know exactly where his house was but they found a kitchen slave quarters and storage rooms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To find the information they use 3D computers to track what is underground. The information is recorded so that other people can start digging. They start skim shovels which are flat shovels. Archeologists then put the soil in a box with a screen at the bottom. This lets dirt fall that is not important. Another team goes to a lab to analyze the objects.</p>	1		20131022130400	554	1		20131022141635	696	1

The archeolgist uncovered armor and weapons. They also discovered the floors of the building. They knew that this would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. The people doing study used computer mapping software to make in image of the area. While digging in the area,the archeologists found the trash the settlers threw away,including the bones of animals they ate.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diggers found pieces of burnt pottery.

For poeple that are not aware, Archeologists are people that study ancient artifacts. They have a vast range of tools, computers, and radar that help them find the artifacts. Some tools are the Pick and Shovel, which most of the digs start with. They are used to dig into the site and find artifacts. Archeologists also use the Whisk and Dustpan, which are used to brush dirt off of artifacts and clear dirt from the dig site. Following, there is the knife, and that is used for causuos digging andmoving dirt from the artifact. Next, we have the Whellbarrow, which is used to move either dirt or items from the dig site, and the Skim Shovel, used to scrape a thin layer of earth from the dig. Finally, there's the Trowel, which is most likely the most common tool for Archeolologists, used to cut and scrape to look at different parts of the soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; One of the digs Archeologists have done is find George Washinton's childhood home. They used the recordings from that time and matched it up with the items. All of them mached! If Archeology weren't around, we could have never done that. So, we should all thank the Archeologists that did that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Last, another dig was made. They found a whole entire fort! This fort was called Fort James. Colonists made it to defend themselves from the Indian tribes. Archeologists have found over a million items there! Some of the items were dolls. They also found a few cellars. Archeologists also found a stone ledge overlooking a stream that had cannons on it once!</p> <p><br> &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021103002	554	2		20131021110741	927	2

In class were are preparing for History Day and writing about the past and how the archeologists found these many diff-rant people in our world.We have been reading about George Washington and The James fort and how there both important.In 1994, a group of people where curious to find about The James fort (It was said that James fort was washed by a river).The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England to start a new life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There were objects found in 1861. They found bones of&nbsp; animals, weapons,and tools that they used back then.Then as they started to move closer and look a bit better they finally found it! First they found many diff-rant markings in the ground that are made from houses.Then they found out that there food source was very low and was difficult to survive. Today archeologists find nearly 1 million objects each year.They have found many diff rant discovery and now plan to figure out and find more amazing finds.They are very important people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They have also been interested in finding more about Washington and his lifestyle back then and what his child hood was like.They found that when he was six he lived on a land named Ferry Farm and it was the perfect place to build a home.The archeologists know this because there was a structure in the middle of a piece of land called Ferry Farm and as they looked into finding who lived here George Washington came up into the picture.They found pipes under the structure and tools tat where aged for millions of years.They found many diff rant facts about George W. When he was eleven years he worked like the other children(Mostly on the land he lived on. As we all know he became president and the people of Ferry Farm where going to show that there a strong community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022110200	223	1		20131022113149	927	1

They go to abandoned historical sights to dig up artifacts. Which are objects from the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A group in 1994 were interested in studying the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. They were going to find and study Fort James. They were going to dig up old objects to study what people used in the old days. It took over 100 years to find the exact spot were Fort James was! The National Park Service led a study of the area to figure out how the land was used. This would help them decide where to look for proof of the fort. That's when they finally found the fort! They found a set of marks on the ground indicating where the fort's wall was. The archeologists knew the fort was a shape of a triangle from all the stories they have heard.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the group finds nearly 1 million objects each year. The objects include pottery, tools, coins, and even little toys for the children. They found trash the settlers threw away in a well or large pit. Including the bones of animals they ate. Archeology gives us a piece of our past and ties us to the people who lived hundreds of years ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists are important because if we didn't have them we would know very little about our past. Also about what life was like in the old days.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021103123	554	2		20131021115315	223	2

We have been asked to give information on archeologist. I have learned they have to be very careful.

The team used 3D computers to scan the underground so they don't miss a single piece of history. One of the many tools the used was a skim shovel. The skim shovel is very flat and pointy. it is built like that so it can pick up more than i layer of dirt at a time.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Inside of another article named <b>Finding Fort James </b>I learned they were looking for Fort James for a long period of time. Then finally found stone walls that used to belong to Fort James. The archeologist spent a whole year just studying the stone walls. After that year they tried to find more evidence that Fort James location was that spot. The walls led to the rest of the fort that went all the way to the river. The many years they worked on the dig was successful. The archeologist also found 11 cellars, 12 burials, and 10 buildings within the border.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have very interesting jobs. I learned you have to be very patient and careful. when you're an archeologists you have to be very smart and review an artifacts several times.

Most of what I know about George Washington is that he comes from his time a great solider and president. Boigraphies don't have very much information about his childhood. Thats changing however. Recent discoveries at George Washington's childhood home have helped all sorts of histotians know alot more information about George Washington as a little boy a long time ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People have lived on the land known as Ferry Farm for a very long time, over 12,000 years. It's location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefor, it's not suprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington , moved his family there. George Washington was just six years old at that time. No one knew exactly were the washington home was located ever since the actual building was long gone. However archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in 2003. It took over a year, but they finally found it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first buildings they found were the kitchen , slave guaters , and storage houses. They found the main farm house a few years later. At least four other houses have been built on the Ferry Farm land, so the diggers needed to find proof that this was George Washingtons farm house. Records show that this was Washingtons had a fire in their house.&nbsp; they lost a lot of there stuff in the fire.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do the archeologists find all of these things that were in Washington's house all those years ago? The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one. Each year, many teams willl work on the site. There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place team does the digging is callled a dig. Those archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These are so small, flat, and sharp they take up soil. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131021105017	223		N	20131021113922	926		N

Some times they find things that are really old and maybe cost so much money and they can go to a plce to find out how much it is worth and the person who found it might turn it in the the cash shere and that person would get that amount of money it was worth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thongs that they show picters of they use them to dig you some things that they are tring to look for or they just found by mistake or something like that. They use the pick and shovel for diging and picking up things that they dont want to pick up with there hands, so they use the pick and shovel for it. They use the shovel for the diging part they use it because things could be stuck and they could not get it with there hands so they use the shovel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whisk is used for dusting things of when they have not been dusted off for a very long time and they cant see what it really is. The dustpan is use for cleaning up messes that have been made befor the people have left befor they have left that area. The other reason they use them for is because they would not want all that dust on there while they are trying to look at it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knife is used for scraping off dirt from some things. They are also used for diging a little spot.The wheelbarrow is used for carring big and havy things out of th area. The skim shovel is used for just taking a little bit of somthing and removing it to a different place somewhere eles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trowel is used for also for taking off thin layers of somthing that you dont want every thing gone you just want that little bit gone and removed. So dont need to wory about taking way to much of a layer off of somthing that you only want a little bit coming off. You also dont need to have that big shovel that takes way to much off of what you only wanted a little bit taken off.</p>	0		20131022131736	934	0		20131022204844	554	1		20131023132117	560	0

They help us discover history. They even digged up George Washington's past! Let's see how!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have learned about George Washington's childhood. He grew up in a place called Ferry Farm. He was only six years old at the time. No one really knew where his home was located because it had been gone for awhile, but Archeologists belived that the stone base beneath the house was still there. They started digging in 2003. They finally found it! The fist buildings they discoverd were kitchens, slave quarters, and storage places, a couple years later,</p> <p>they found the main farmhouse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding Washington's was important for a lot of reasons. One reason is that it gives the citizens of the U.S a better understanding of who he was before he became president. Another is it help historians learn about life our past Americans lived.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists is an important job. We wouldn't know half of what we know noe without them.

Both articles are based on how archeologists find artifacts from really famous places.One place where they went was to the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The second place the archeologists went was to a house where they thought that George Washington lived in long ago. I am going to tell you what they did, researched, and analyzed in both places.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group of archeologists are&nbsp; interested in studying things from long ago with the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological Project. This project was formed to discover some of the deep secrets hidden in the James Fort in Jamestown, Virginia. The jobs of these archeologists is to find the hidden artifacts in James Fort. The first objects were found in 1861. The archeologists or the the scientists who study objects from the past, uncovered many weapons and armor. They found floors of buildings, too. At least 100 years later, another group came and tried to find the exact spot where the fort was built. The National Park Service led a five- year service of the area to find out how the land was used. They always knew that this would help them find proof of the fort. The people studying this used computer mapping to look at an image of the area. That's when they finally found the James Fort! A set of marks on the ground was the very first thing they saw. they showed where the fort's walls used to be. Between everything they research, heard and read about, they knew that the fort was going to be shaped like a triangle. They made maps and that showed him that is stretched out all the way to he river. The archeologists always were researching and trying to find out many new things about many ancient things and places. That is what makes their jobs so interesting and importing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where George Washington lived and spent his childhood was another place that the archeologists went to. The archeologists went there to find out if that <b>was </b>where George Washington lived as a child. There, they found proof to rediscover the place where George Washington lived. As a result, thy keep on finding many more things that lead to the conclusion that what they wanted to discover was true. The discovery of George Washington's&nbsp; home was extremely important for many reasons. First of all, it makes the citizens of the United States understand George Washington's life story and<u> </u>give them a better understanding of where he lived and actually walked through before becoming famous and being the first president of the United States. Second of all, we would know the decisions he made and why. Lastly, it helps us learn how the Colonial Americans lived. The archeologists found many artifacts and things that belonged to George and he used.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So, now you know the things that archeologists do for a living. Their intersting job helps them and many other people understand the ways of people that lived long ago. Archeologists learn, even though they already know alot. Having that job is great for understanding the lives of famous people back then. So, now you can understand the jobs of archeologists and what they do for a living and how they do it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022114129	560	2		20131022130631	551	2		20131023111254	509	2

Now lets get digging!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists usually work in very dusty enviornments where there is a very large chance of finding ancient artifacts, such as toys, tools, inventions, and even entire buildings or cities! The artifacts they find are their pay, so the more items found, the more money. But it is very hard to find these objects, and most archeologists are lucky to find one every week! The items are also used for reasearch on past cultures. For example, if a goblet was found in Greece, it would most likely be sent to greek mythology professors for research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The tools of an archeologist are very simple.You have the pick and shovel, but did you know there are more than six others? The shovel is, obviously the most common tool found with archeologists. The pick is used where the shovel cannot pierce the ground. It is very heavy, and has two very sharp ends used for cracking rock. Then there is the whisk and dustpan. They may not be very big, but they are essential tools to archeologists. The whisk is used to clear dust from delicate objects, such as teacups or very old books.The duspan is used to gather up the dirt and see if it has special minerals inside. Now we come to the knife, another essential, but small, tool. The knife is used for getting most of the dirt off of artifacts so that the whisk can get the remainder, because a whisk is only a brush and can't get all of that dirt off. I could go on and on about the tools, because there are many out there, but I digress.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So, as you can see, the life of an archeologist is a very confusing and long one, but in most cases, a fun and challenging one.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022113956	563	2		20131022205132	554	2

They explore and study anything from a sercet fort to a Old Presidents house!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use many tools while exploring and there are quite interesting. They use picks and shovels to dig into the Earth. The whisk and dust pan is used for brushing off artifacts to see more detailing in the object. Also they use knifes for scrapping dirt around artifacts not for cutting our dinner like we do. Wheelbarrows are used to get dirt away from where there are studying. The skim shovel is used to scoop a small layer of soil. A trowel is used to cut the view the different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have found the James Fort that we thought we had lost for years by the river sweeping it away but we were wrong! The fort was built in 1607 and was used for surviving attacks, there were even canons! We found artifacts such as pottery, tools, coins, and much more.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Also they have found George Washington's House when he was a kid. They started digging on Ferry Farm in 2003 and it took over 1 year! What do you think they found at his old house? The diggers found burnt pottery. They knew this house was George's because his house burned down in a fire. Also because they found pipes and George was known to smoke them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's amazing what archeologists can do! Do you want to be one when you grow up? They make a big difference on Earth and without them we wouldn't know what we know today.</p>	2		20131021085239	695	2		20131021201943	551	2

An Artifact is something that helps show</p> <p>infomation that came from the past. Archeologists can discover many things like dinosaur bone, pieces of old buildings, and even ship recks.</p> <p>Tools that archeoligist use for outside work are like picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows,</p> <p>skim shovels, and trowels. But not all archeologists work outside, they can work inside too. The archeologist that work outside do digging and search for artifacts. Thats hard work! The archeologists that work inside analise stuff and do research.</p> <p>I'm sure that archeology can be fun but it sounds like hard work too. So if you ever want to be an archeologist</p> <p>its hard work but it sounds like fun.</p>	1		20131022115612	559	1		20131022204448	554	1

In the following essay i will explain how Archeologists find things of the past, what they use and how they used it.</p> <p>To start off, Archeologists use Picks &amp; Shovels to mostly dig up dirt, stone , and other minerals. A whisk &amp; Dustpan is used to clear artifacts of dust and grime and to clear from the site. In excavation site is the trowel, which scrapes and cuts soil to examine. Most items used are for scrapping and removal but the skim shovel uses a thin metal plate and carefully removes a thin layer of soil.</p> <p>Archeologists find many things that they don't know what to do with then send it to a special facility to get it named, discovered, and even broken down into smaller pieces of the artifact, but most of the time they find bones and fossils that have decayed over time. Archeologists send most things they get from a dig site to a museum and get rich and wealthy. People help and pay for some digs and they get half or maybe even full pay of items, money, and artifacts. Some of the dig people have done either came out bad or even the archeologists die in the dig. Even though archeologists dig some find rare items in time like George Washington watch.</p> <p>After all, Archeologists uncover secrets they cant uncover all of the secrets they find. Would you ever want to be an Archeologist</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021201944	551	0		20131022110449	554	1		20131022134636	533	2

Archeologist are really cool people that look for things that were all the way back in the 1600s. Like the James Fort in Jamestown. A lot of people beleived that it ws located near a river. Then one day archeologist found objects nearby, they suggessted the fort was further away. They began their hunt. the first objects were found in 1861, they also found floors of buildings. 100 years later they found where the fort was built. They took some artifacts back to their lab where they used computer mapping and software to make an image of the area.That 's when they found it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acheologist use some cool tools to help dig for artifacts and clear dirt from artifacts. They use tools like a whisk and dustpan and a skim shovel. Everybody knows who George Washington was but no one knows him as a boy. People have lived on the land called Ferry Farm for years. It is not suprising that George Washington 's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George Washington was just six years old. No one knew where his house was located, however archeologist think that there was a stone base under the house. They started digging, it took a year, then they finally found it they artifacts with it. The whisk and dustpan was used for some of the artifacts like pottery they found.The skim shovel was used to dig up the soil, it can dig up one thin of soil every scoop.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologist never give up and they are very careful. Even though it took them 100 years to find the James Fort in Jamestown they never gave up they stuck to what they had to do. They were also very careful. They made sure they didn 't pass up any artifacts or dig to hard when they were looking for George Washington 's house.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can be an archeologist too. It is very fun to learn about history and use those cool tools. Even though you may not no what it is you can still give it a try if your young or&nbsp; old.</p>	1		20131021092248	559	1		20131021095405	550	2		20131021221016	509	1

I like it when you get to see old objects that know one uses or has seen. with this job you have to go to collage for awhile. I would say for about 3 or 4 years. what you do is first look at the article that you find or that has been provided for you. Then you write a topic or response about what the article is or means. And make sure you double check to see if you are correct about what you have wrote. then you look at many helpful ressorces or objects. The main part of the job is to see what people back then did. like what they ate and what they played as games and also what they made. When I grow up Im going to do this job because this is something really intresting to me.

You might have some questions though such as, &quot;Who are archeologists?&quot; or &quot;What do they do?&quot; Well, archeologists are people who study artifacts or objects from the past or dig up mysterious or well known artifacts from the past. They are important because, they help us discover past artifacts such as, James Fort or George Washington's clay pipes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Discovering James Fort</u></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Fort was built in 1607 when settlers wanted to start a new life. In 1994, a group of archeologists studied the past started the Jamestown Rediscovery Archaeological project. The project mission was to discover the secrets of the James Fort. But, beforethat, the first items were found in 1861. Archeologists found armor and weapons. Then, 100 years later, a group found the exact location where the fort began. The National Park Service studied for five years to discover how the land was used. They used computer mapping to make an image for that certain area. Then, they finally found James Fort! First, they found marking on the ground. The marks displayed where the fort's walls used to be. Then, they found stone ledges built over the river which, were designed to hold cannons. Also, archologists found 11 cellars, lots of burial sights, and 10 buildings! For archeoloists this was a fantastic discovery and a great acheivement that will be remembered by the forever!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><u>Tools</u></u></p> <p>&nbsp; Archeologists use many different tools for all of their hard work. Most, if not all, of the tools were used for digging as you can probably imagine. One of the tools they use is a shovel. A shovel is used to dig up the dirt. Another one of the tools they use is a pick or pickaxe. A pickaxe's job is very similar to a shovel even, though they look different. A pickaxe is used to dig into the Earth. Unlike, the shovel it is used to dig stone and harder subtances than the shovel. Now, let's talk about the whisk and the dustpan. You probably used these before in your homes. A whisk is used to sweep up dirt into the dustpan. You can probably picturing yourself using this tool at home. Now, lets move on to the knife. Another tool you probably use in your everyday life. But, for archeologists it is used differently. A knife is used for carefully used for digging and to scrape dirt from the artifacts.

What about different historical facts they've discovered? Soon you will be an expert on all of these topics and more.</p> <p>First you need to know the tools they used. These are some tools they use:</p>  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Pick and Shovel <br>Whisk and Dustpan <br>Knife <br>Wheelbarrow <br>Skim Shovel <br>Trowel  <p>These are used for scraping away layers, digging shallow and deep digs, and transporting and clearing materials such as dirt. When archeologists search for hidden mysteries buried beneath the ground, they can't just jump right in, they have to check all their equipment and determine which tool is best for the work their doing. If they were looking for small delicate artifacts right beneath the surface they night use a knife or a skim shovel and then a whisk to dust treasures off. If they were looking for the base of a building buried deep in the ground, they would probably use a pick and shovel and then a wheelbarrow to wheel away dirt.</p> <p>If it weren't for groups like The National Park Service or Ferry Farm we wouldn't know very much about America's history. Ferry Farm discovered George Washington's life before he became president. It took a year just to find the stone base of his house. The National Park Service conducted a five-year investigation of James Fort. It's hard to believe, but this group finds approximately 1 million artifacts each year! They've found tools, coins, metal toys for children, pottery, etc.</p> <p>Now you know all about the job of an archeologist. Could you even imagine how much effort each person puts in <b>each day</b>. It's hard work being an archeologist!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022130218	555	2		20131022205343	554	2

The things they find includes pottery,tools,coins and even metal toys for children. in the 1600s, people used to throw their trash down in an unused well or a pit.

Archeologists go onto excavations to find abandoned places and find artifacts that are probably worth more than a mansion. They explore the world looking for places to excavate. They find many things, and the job pays well, (probably).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists do many fun things and use many different tools. They use these tools during an excavation, which is the hard part of being an archeologist. You dig in the ground carefully and once you find what you're looking for, you carefully dig around it. If it's a buried artifact, you carefully grab it with gloved hands and bring it up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's a building that has been covered in dirt, then dig around until you've found the door, because most buildings have doors. Once you're in, you look around the building for artifacts, if there are any in the building.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, an archeologist's work is simple, but not easy.</p>	2		20131021201426	926	2		20131022095534	554	2

My name is Erik Dollani and I am a fifth grader at Endeavor Elementary in Kentwood, Mi. I will tell you about the job of an archeologist and what one does. Now enough chit chat, lets get this started!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well if you think about it I first thought that an archeologist was a person that dug up dinosaurs but he does that and much more. Like for example in source #2 it says that the archeologists had to find the right house because they were looking for George Washington's house, then after they found it they could start working. How did they find it you say?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well they needed to find proof that the farmhouse they found was the right one so looked at Records of his life. The records showed that his house had a fire so the archeologists had to find a burned house that not only looked like George Washington's house but again needed proof.&nbsp; So when they started to dig (the house was</p> <p>so long ago dirt buried it) they found pieces of burnt pottery, a part of a clay pipe, etc. The clay pipe is when they were looking at the records they also found that he smoked clay pipes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know what a archeologist does for a living. So maybe you could grow up and be a archeologist or whatever you want to be. And while I'm at it I might as well be one too. &quot;Sigh another happy costumer&quot;!</p>	1		20131022131705	934	1		20131022140506	542	1		20131023133315	533	1

It's a person who carefully digs up artifacts. Archeologists have a very difficult job. They have to very carefully and gently clean and find artifacts. They have to have gentile hands when they work and a lot of patents. It may take them up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! That's along time!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Archeologists can find many things. Some archeologist found the remains of Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia. Others found some things from George Washington's childhood, from his childhood home. Lots of things have been found by archeologists. Lots more are waiting to be found.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place where archeologists do the digging, is called a dig. Archeologists have many tools:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br><u>Pick and Shovel-</u> Lots of digs start with these tools. They are used to dig into the earth, to get closer to the artifacts. <br><u>Whisk and Dustpan-</u> This is used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away the dirt from the excavation site. <br><u>Kn</u><u>ife-</u> This tool is used for careful digging, and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. <br><u>Wheelbarrow-</u> these are used to move items from one place to another, or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. <br><u>Skim Shovel-</u> A shovel with a flat edge. This is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop. <br><u>Trowel-</u> This is probably the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil.  <p>Archeologists have though jobs, long ones too. I think it might be cool to be an archeologist, but maybe not. It would be cool to find something. But I don't think I have the patents. I like reading about them. I hope you do too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131018145212	927	1		20131018153436	546	2		20131021091316	560	1

There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that people will know what it looked like&nbsp; before people stared digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging , and the&nbsp; place the team does the digging is called a dig. Those archeologist&nbsp; start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These are to small ,flat and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, at a time. That soil is than placed in a box&nbsp; with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets&nbsp; the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt. It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-feet section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm going to tell you what it means.The discovery of Washington home is important for many reasons. first, it gives the citizens of the United states a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became famous. We also begin to know why he made the decision he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of life Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as many lived Americans. Digging around in the dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at Ferry Farm are bringing to life the country's first president in ways we have never seen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm going to tell you about getting involved Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved. The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classrooms and outdoor activities.&nbsp; Kids can explore the site, experience colonial life, and became junior archeologist. Kids can sign can sign up for classes, games, and crafts. There is even an interacitve website!

ARCHOELOGISTS THE NAME FOR SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY OBJECTS FROM THE PAST, UNCOVERED AMOR AND WEAPONS. THEY ALSO DISCOVERED THE FLOORS OF BUILDINGS. OVER 100 YEARS LATER A GROUP OF EFFORT TO FIND EXACLY SPOT WHERE THERE HOME WAS. NO ONE KNEW EXACLY WHERE THE WASHINTON'S HOME WAS LOCATED SINCE THE ACTUAL BUILDING WAS LONG&nbsp; GONE. HOWEVER, ARCEOLOGISTS BELIEVE THAT THE STONE BASE&nbsp; UNDER THE HOUSE WAS STILL THERE. THEY STARTED DIGGING IN 2003. IT TOOK OVER A YEAR , BUT THEY FINALLY FOUND IT. THE FRIST BUILDINGS THEY FOUND&nbsp; WERE THE KITCHEN, SLAVE QUARTERS, AND STORAGE HOUSES.THEY FOUND THE MAIN FARMHOUSE A FEW YEARS LATER. <br>AT LEAST FOUR OTHER HOUSE HAVE BEEN BUILT ON FERRY FARM LAND, SO THE DIGGERS NEEDED TO FIND PROOF THAT ThIS WASWASHTINTONS FARM HOUSE.RECORDS SHOW THAT THE WASHINTONS HAD A FIRE IN THEIR HOUSE. THE DIGGERS&nbsp; FOUND PIECES OF BURNT POTTERY.THIS SUGGESTS A FIRE&nbsp; OCCURRED THERE.THEY ALSO FOUND PART OF A CLAY PIPE.WE KNOW THAT WASHINTON SMOKED CLAY PIPES, SO THIS DISCOVERY GIVES MORE PROOF IT IS THE RIGHT HOUSE. <br>PEOPLE HAVE&nbsp; LIVED ON THE FERRY FARM FOR OVER 12,000 YEARS.IT'S LOCATION MAKES IT A PERFECT PLACE TO BUILD A HOME. THEREFORE, IT'S NOT&nbsp; SURPRISING THAT GEORGEGE WASHINTON'S FARTHER,AUGUSTINE WASHINTON, MOVED HIS FAMILY THERE. GEORGE WAS JUST SIX YEARS OLD AT THE TIME. <br>THIS DISCOVERY OF WASHINTON'S HOME IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS. FRIST,IT GIVES THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO GOERGE WASHINTON WAS BEFORE HE BECAME FAMOUS. WE ALSO BEGIN TO KNOW WHY HE MADE THE DECISIONS HE DID. ANOTHER THING IT DOSE IS HELP HISTOIANS LEARN ABOUT THE TYPE OF LIFE COLONIAL AMERICANS LIVED.

No one knew exactly where the Washington home was located since the actual building was not there. Archeologists thought that the stone base under the house was still there. They started digging in the early 2002 or 2003. It took almost a year to complete. They&nbsp; used 3D cameras to find the base of the house.

If you are frustrated while working you won't get a lot of work done. They don't just zoom through their work, they take their time and handle the artifacts carefully.

Being a archeologist can be a intresting person because you can find intresting stuff like achient stuff and even old stuff from&nbsp; &nbsp; another place far far away.The stuff that you will need is a shovel,pickax,and a wheelbarrow now when you have all those materials you will have to go to a&nbsp; far&nbsp; place where you think where you think you will find any kind of artifacts.So if you find a artifact you have to take it to a reall special place like a huge musiem where people can see it. &nbsp;&nbsp; When you take it to that musiem where people can see it they will tell you where you put it then they will reward you with alot of money because when its like from 1991-2012 they will say hey that looks really really old because that time you took it to the musiem they will take alot of pictures of what you have tooken to the musiem. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also when you are older people will have many questions for you to ask because they would want to know where you found it and how long has it took you to find that very important imfomation and special thing you found mabe you it was your dream come true.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if if you want to be archeologist just read my story and you will understand what would you find when you turn into one or not just go the web sight called ecolocicolpedia well you know what i mean so just type it in archeologist in in that web sight so if you find it what you were looking for i am glad that you have found it ! see ya later aligator have a nice day.</p>	0		20131021103123	554	1		20131021112954	546	1		20131022095450	560	0

The kife is used to carefully dig and to scrape dirt from from around artifacts.Those were the ones used the most.The next three tools they use some times.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The wheelbarrow is used to move items from place to place or to carry dirt away from the excvation site see wheel barrows are handy when your artifacts are deep into the ground for all that dirt you have to dig through so all you have to do is transport the dirt out side of the site.The skim shovel is flat edged used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil with each scoop it looks like an every day shovel wrong its the same tool but its specily made for lifting up artifacts just incase if the wheel barrow is full you have anther option. The trowel is the most common tool to an archeologists it is used to scrape and cut to view the different layers of soil. Thats why I choose Archeologists for my history day project.</p>	1		20131021093145	927	0		20131021100000	535	0		20131021223447	509	1

When you find an artifact you might learn something from it. If you read about the person that your finding an artifact from, it can help you on your search. Some archeologists never give up from finding an artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp;If there is an artifact buried underground, archeologists would dig it up with a shovel and put the dirt in their wheelbarrow. If a artifact had dirt on it, archeologists would use a whisk and dustpan to clean it up. When they need to put the dirt somewhere they would put it in their wheelbarrow. It might take an hour or more for them to find some hidden artifacts. If archeologists are far from a museum it would take them a while to get their.</p> <p>&nbsp;Archeologists get paid by people just for finding old artifacts.

Archeologist can find interesting things of people that have vanished that might have did something great to change the world. An archeologist gets to learn about the history of someone if they didn't now anything about them. Some archeologist starts their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat and sharp that they can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This lets the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called a troweling. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paintbrushes and wooden picks to remove dirt from the artifacts that are found. It can take up two weeks to dig a 25-square foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the tools that are used by archeologist are the pick and shovel-most digs start with these two tools. Used to dig into the earth, close to the artifacts. Whisk and Dustpan- used to brush dirt off the artifcats and clear away dirt from the excavation site.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be up to 35 people on a team! The first team maps the area using <b>3D</b> computers that can track what is underground. The information is recorded so that the people will know what it looked like before people started digging. I think the job of an archeologist would be cool because you get to learn about the past history of many wonderful people.</p>	2		20131021132008	547	2		20131021140140	546	1		20131022161558	533	2

First you would have to try and find artifacts. It is also interesting because archeologists get to learn more about the past. It would also be hard because you have to spend days or weeks on finding an artifact, I also think the job of being an archeologist is pretty amazing because you would get to discover cool artifacts from the past that nobody has known about yet, also in the reading section it is written that archeologist discover old artifacts from the past like George Washington's burnt pottery.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I think it is important that archeologists tried their best to take their time on finding artifacts. An archeologist would have to be careful to use the right tools to use at the right time or they might mess up.Archeologists also have to be patient because if they aren't patient they would just probably get mad and tried of just digging and tried to dig faster and instead they might just destroy the artifact. If an archeologist finds an artifact then it means they have discovered a piece of America's past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also they get to find information that nobody has known about yet and information to add on to what we already know. Archeologists also have be the kind of person that does not loses their temper very easily&nbsp; because if they did they might just throw the artifact on the ground and it might break into tiny pieces.An archeologist would have to work hard and they might probably have to have some experience with technology because they might have to work with computers to locate where an artifact is. An archeologists job is mainly to dig up artifacts from the past to find out more about the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The job of an archeologist is also important because the past of America relies on them. Also archeologists have to be careful on finding artifacts.The job of an archeologist is important because in the reading section &quot;Finding Fort James&quot; it is written that there is a group of archeologists to discover about James Fort. Archeologists have to dig up the past so that we can know more about America's past.These are some of the things that I think about for the job of an archeologist. An archeologist's job is important for us because we need to know more about the past.</p>	2		20131022110350	695	2		20131022142654	925	2

The project was for Jamestown, Virgina for over 200 years. People thought that Jamestown had been washed away for a long time.Some people might think its still around.The fort was built in 1607 when settlers came from England. They believe that James Fort was built near a river. It was found in 1861 over hundred years later some people went out to find the exact spot where it was built. People did a computer map to make a image of the fort. When peple found James Fort the first thing they did was</p> <p>make&nbsp; marks on the ground.The marks they made showed where the walls used to be at.They found out that in the fort there were canons in the fort and a dozen burial sites and ten all buildings in the border of the fort.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All the things people know about George washington are about his time a soldier and president. people dont know that much about his childhood some people resently found more about his childhood.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>George was only six years old when his family moved&nbsp; to Ferry Farm no one knows where his home was at because the actual building had been gone for a long time. people started digging in 2003 for the stone base from the washingtons house that they thought was still there it took over a year to find but the people found the stone base of the house. The first buildinds they found were the kitchen,slave quarters and the storage houses a few years later they found the main farmhouse.There were at least four other houses that had been built on Ferry Farm.Records say that the washing tons house was set on fire the people found pieces of burnt pottery they also found part of a clay pipe this gives proof it is the right house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021105749	516		T	20131021112917	547	0		20131025083750	509	1

Artifacts are the belongings of people that lived long ago, such as pottery, jewelry, and coins. Archeologists dig to find all things like that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists use tools such as picks, shovels, Trowels, wheelbarrows, and knives. Archeologists use all of these tools for a different purpose, shovels to clear dirt, picks to clear rocks, wheelbarrows to move dirt, trowels to delicately remove dirt, and knives to clear dirt from artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists have a hard job they have to dig a very long time to find anything, normally. It takes Almost 2 weeks to dig a 25-square-foot hole, so it does, in-fact, take a lot of time. Archeologists normally work in 2 teams one researches found artifacts and looks at the area from 3D computers and charts out the land, while the other digs for artifacts. Digging for artifacts is very long process and you need to have enough strength to endure a lot of digging, as well as heat and sweat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After artifacts are found the possessing team examines, cleans, and researches all the found artifacts and they either get thrown away or gets put in a museum.</p>	2		20131021192958	563	2		20131022093703	547	2

That is because there are many good and bad things about the job. You may call these pros and cons. In this report I will tell you about the job. After you read this you decide if you want to be an archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Job of an archeologist you will learn about history by digging up, studying, and graphing famous places in history. now, you won't be doing all of this at once. The archeologist are broken up into teams. There can be up to thirty-five people on a team! The first team graphs and maps the area on three dimensional computers. How cool is that! The second team works on the actual digging. They start their digging with a tool called skim shovels. Skim shovels are flat, small, and sharp. Troweling is another process. Troweling is when archeologist use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt from artifacts. When you are digging it can take up to two weeks to dig a twenty-five square-foot section! The other team spends days in the lab studying the artifacts. It takes a long time to figure out the story and reason for the artifact, but the outcome is huge!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this paragraph I will tell you the good things about the job of an archeologist. One good thing about the job is that you would uncover, or dig up, pieces of history. When you uncover pieces of history it helps many people, including average Americans not just archeologist. When you help people you help them in these ways: You help American citizens a better understanding of the situation. It helps People understand why things are the way they are. The last reason is it helps historians learn how life was at the time. Another reason an archeologist is a good job to have is you could dig up one of a kind items like a cavemen spear so it could be a good paying job. A good thing about the job as an&nbsp; archeologist is you could make new friends at the digging site. Those are all the good things about being a archeologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some bad things about the job of an archeologist is you probably not be around your family a lot unless they work with you. Another bad thing about the job is that you are working in the sun all day and you would get really hot and sweaty and you would probably get a lot of sun burns over the summer. You are working in mud all day if you are a digger so you would be filthy, so that is a bad thing about the job. Money would be a problem depending on the site and amount of things you find there so that could be good or bad.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's time for you to decide do you want to be an archeologist? I wouldn't do as a full time job but I would try it someday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131018144318	934	1		20131018154727	926	2		20131021092407	533	2

Archeologists have tough jobs, but strange enough, they seem to like their job. Whenever they are digging at a important site, they have to be careful that they are using the right tools. They have to use thin tools, so that they can dig thin layers of soil at a time. They also have to be careful that they don't damage any artifacts while digging through the soil. They have 3-D computers that they use so that they can see what is under the soil, and that they don't accidentally step on something that is valuable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Learning About the Past</u></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Archeologists have dug at George Washington's home.

Now let's think of that word, Archeologist. What do they go through to find the artifacts, what problems do they encounter. Being an archeologist is a hard job. You must have great patience and patience is a virtue. It can take years to find such treasure, just like the archeologists who tried hard to scour the Ferry Farm for George Washingtons homestead. It took them a good amout of years to find even a few artifacts. But let's not go to far into that, and get close to the real subject.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arceologist have to use many methods to find ancient arifacts. They slowly dig using tools such as picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knives, wheelbarrows, skim shovels, and trowels. Some tools allow these scientists to carefully dig for treasure. They also can use tools like the pick to dive through tough rocks. Methods that they use can be methods such as sending teams at differrent times, making 3D models that track things underground, and checking notes before digging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, archeologists must have many tools and methods. Without them, the scientists can get lost to many times. Archeologists can have very hard jobs, yet it benefits them in the end.</p>	1		20131022131802	934	1		20131022203418	550	1

And then take the dirt to a box and put the dirt inside. And the box has a half a inch screen so that lets the dirt out an the artifacts stay in. Another&nbsp; process of digging is called troweling. Troweling is when diggers use small shovels,paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last process is wean the dirt and the artifacts are separated the archeologists send them to the last team at the lab.

There was a process going on where up to 35 people were digging at a Ferry Farm.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discovering Washingtons house gave the citizens a better understanding of the infamous George Washington's life. George Washington's father moved his family to a ferry farm when George Washington was 6 years old. Archeologists started digging in 2003 to find the base of George Washington's house to get its location of where the house was actually sitting. One year later they found the location of the house. The ferry farm that Washington lived on gave lots of children lots of things to do. The children had lots of games and puzzles to do on the farm. Washington had society going that ran summer workshops.

An archeologist is another name for a scientist who looks for stuff at historical places. An archeologist usually finds artifacts for museums or other places. When an archeologist finds something, it's usually not something modern day-like.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists have tools that they have to use so they don't get the artifact dirty. Also they have to use the tools so they don't damage the artifact. When an archeologist damages or gets an item dirty, it dosen't have as much value. When it dosen't have as much value, the museum may not want it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also should wear gloves so they don't get fingerprints on the artifact. If they get fingerprints on the artifact, the have to wash it. When they was it, it could have something important on it that they wash off. If they was it off, again, it might not be worth as much or lose value.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists should also make sure they don't carry they heavy things too recklessly. They should use a wheelbarrow. But, they shouldn't use a wheelbarrow for they light objects. If they go too recklessly with the light objects, they will probably break. Same with the large objects.</p>	2		20131021190544	559	2		20131022104707	925	1		20131022113743	533	2

The job of a acheologist is finding the evedence of where historys people lived, went, had, or there secrets. Being a acheologist can be hard or fun depending if you like it. They use many tools too like the pick and shovel, whisk and dustpan, knife, wheel barrow, skimshovel, and the trower. For acheologist diging up a sene or place can take a while maybe even years long! But its all worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a archeologist takes time and hard work to find artifacts that no one a found. As a archeologist you can find many things like packs of sigerets, clothes, possibly weapons, and all sorts of stuff! As a acheologist you can find things no person has found or discovered.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do archeologist find all these things?- Well what they have are teams of 35 to take a turn and work on the site. So wht the first team does is maps the area using a 3D computser which can track to see what is underground. What the firt team of archeologist do is record the things under so the next team knows where to dig up what is under. After all that they keep on going and going. It can take very very long to dig these places up, it takes two weeks just to dig up a 25-square foot section too! Last of all the last team spends days studying the objects they found in there lab. The whole thing is slow and hard, but its all worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you never knew, finding Washinton's house is important to many people because first, it give every person a better understanding of who George Washington was before he had died. The only people who can find this out is the archologist. Finding these clues about famous people really do help people figure out thing about people they never knew. Why is this so important? These famous people may have had or done things we all dont know about. Think about it, maybe Washington made a crime before the war, maybe Ben Franklin was in the war fighting with a gun. But you never know. This is the job of a acheologist.</p>	1		20131022113730	563	0		20131022130631	551	1		20131023094821	533	1

Archeologist aren't the only people in the world who have found dinosaure bones before or that have found a fossil or two before.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologist aren't the only people in the world who can go and find bones and fossils for a living lots of people aren't archeologist and they go and pick up fossils and bones for a living . So if you find somthing that looks like a bone or a fossil bring it to your school or bring it to a place were they could find out if it is a fossil or a rock. You don't have to be embaressed about brining somthing to a place where they would know what it is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; </p><p>If you are a kid who wants to be a archeologist when they grow up you have to study a lot. If you want to be an archeologist when you are even a grown up you can go to college and study about different animals bones and you will have to know the difference between fossils and rocks. You are never to young to start to study to be an archeologist.But you do have to have a good edacution.</p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021155601	550	0		20131022105350	516	1		20131022143727	533	1

They use picks, shovels, whisks, dustpans, knifes, wheelbarrows, skim, shovels, and trowels and search for things. Once they find a weird little item, they brush it off and observe it. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but in the end something is found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1994, archet ologists gather together and searched for what seemed to be James Fort. People thought that it was washed away by a river;however, they didn't go searching for possible artifacts. Discoveries in the area are hinted that James Fort is still around.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>James Fort was built in 1607. The first objects were found in 1861. The items found were armor and weapons. Then the National Park Service led a five-year observation of the area to find James Fort. They looked for proof that James Fort was still there. That's when they found it. The proof was that they found marks where walls used to be. Their mission was complete.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archaeologists wanted to find George Washington's past so they went to Ferry Farm. They started digging at 2003. It took over one year, but finally it was found. They first identified a kitchen, slave quarters, and storage houses. Main farmhouses were found later.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Records indicate that George Washington's house caught on fire. They found a clay pipe. We know that George Washington smoked a pipe. Therefore, the evidence is relevant.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Digging up the past takes work to do. It is tiresome, but worth it in the end.

Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes,and wooden picks to remove dirt.It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! another tams spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. the whole process in slow and tiresome, but it's Worth it.</p>	N		20131021132047	547		N	20131021143549	926		N

So it was up to the computers to find the dig spot. After scanning the area they found it, George Washington's house. Now it is time for the diggers to come in. they dug for over one year until finally they uncovered the Washington estate in 2004. Still they kept digging after that and a few years later they uncovered the main farmhouse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We still don't know about some famous people's past life so to this day archeologist are searching for more evidence of these people's childhood. There still may be more about the revolutionary war, or about the boycotts. this is one of the reasons archeologist still are trying to uncover the secrets of our worlds past. Though it may be long and tiring archeologist find the artifacts because the think it is worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The job of an archeologist is an interesting job, yet it requires a lot of patience. Those who choose the life of an archeologist may get bored after 25 five days of uncovering one single area, but the one thing they look forward to is finding things no one else has found. Still patience is needed they have to send it off to a lab to examine it for a very long time. Then after that you may finally become famous because of what you found.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude this essay the life of and archeologist has its ups and its downs, but even we can learn from archeologist not just about antic items we can also learn patience. Anoughther thing if you thought it would be all dirt and nothing else think again archeologist find many thing in one dig. Finaly acheologist may spend along time digging but in the end it is realy worth it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021115750	926	1		20131021145013	927	2		20131021221553	509	1

Well, if you didn't &quot;Finding Fort James&quot; by Cheryl Bradley and &quot; Digging up George Washington's Past&quot; by Gloria Corres ?? explains you all about it. Archeologist's job may be hard and difficult but, if you accomplish what are you looking for they will have a joy.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin, it will be very hard. It will be hard because you have to find the place at first. Next, you need to dig until you find it. Then, you need to get rid of the dust. It is very hard and waste of your time when it is not a artifacts. If you find it it will be nice. You need to buy many equipments too. Like whisk, wheelbarrows, pickaxes, shoves etc.also, you will need lots of crews to find your artifact. It will be hard to dig all the places by yourself. You will need 3D computers too! you will need it because you need to see the land, landscapes, how deep is artifact, and where is the artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other case, it would be difficult. you need to find a artifact, if you didn't you need to go to another place. Also, it takes a long time to find a research and a proof. If they don.t believe what you found it would be a waste. Then, you will be popular and then you will need to find more. Also it is a risk for your life. if artifact is in the volcano you might die.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the joy will come. You will have a great success because of your artifact. It is worth it to risk your life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The archeologist's job may be hard but, it will be worth it.

The skim shovel has a flat edge.That edge is used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil&nbsp; with each scoop.That is what the skim shovel is used for.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth is the whisk and dustpan. The whisk and dustpan are used to carefully brush dirt off the artifact and to clear dirt away from the excavation site.This is so it won't get to dusty.That is what the whisk and dustpan is for.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth tool is the knife. the knife is used to</p>	2		20131021155513	695	2		20131022102658	223	2

Well, you have come to the right place! In this article, you will learn all about the study of artifacts, otherwise known as archeology. If you want to learn more about this marvelous art, then read on!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, it helps us learn all of the facts that may not be seen in biographies. This was stated in the article titled <b><u>Digging up George Washington's Past</u></b>, &quot;Most of what we know of George Washington comes from his time as a soldier and president. Biographies don't have much information about his childhood. That's changing, however. Recent discoveries at Washington's childhood home have helped historians know more about Washington as a boy.&quot; This shows how by archeology we can find out more about historical people, landmarks and place. Due to this compelling quote it should be easy for one to see how important archeology is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there are six essential tools to learn about before becoming a world class architect: {from <b><u>Tools Used by Archeologists</u></b>}</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br>Pick and Shovel: This is used to dig into the earth in order to get close to artifacts. <br>Whisk and Dustpan: Together these are used to clear off dirt from artifacts and the excavation site. <br>Knife: Used for<b> </b><u>careful</u> digging. <br>Wheelbarrow: To move items or carry away dirt. <br>Skim Shovel: To remove a <u>thin</u> layer of soil. <br>Trowel: To scrape and cut layers of soil.  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, how do you practice the art of archeology. Well there are various methods but we will only cover there most basic ones today. There are three teams of people as large as 35 people. One team maps the area using 3 dimensional&nbsp; computers to track the underground. Another team does the &quot;real digging&quot;. The last team studies the artifacts that are found. Working together is very important in archeology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, archeology must be fun and I would love to be an archeologist. All in all, archeology is a very important study. Maybe in the generations&nbsp; of the generations of the future their will be technology to scan for artifacts and to analyze them.

The things that they dig up is called artifacts. Artifacts can help us know about the people of the past. We could know how they lived, how they worked what they used to live, and etc.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists work in groups. Some study the artifacts, while others do the digging. Before the digging,there is a group with 3D computers that that track what is underground. People work in teams. there could be more than 35 people on a team . the digging site is called a dig. People dig out dirt to get the artifacts. Archeologists need patience. Digging could take month or even years. It can take two weeks to dig 25 square feet of dirt. Digs begin with pick and shovel, which is also the most common tools used by acheologists. Sometimes, you won't find anything at the dig, but other times, you will find artifacts. Some artifacts are very precious. It is worth the effort of digging for a very long time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Many kinds of tools are used by archeologists. Pick and shovels are used to dig into the dirt to find artifacts. Whisk and dustpan are used to cean dust off artifacts. A knife is used to scrape the dirt around the artifact. Wheelbarrow is used to carry dirt and artifacts. Skim shovel is used to remove thing layers of dirt. A&nbsp; Trowel is used to scape and cut to view different layers of dirt. It is one of the most common tools for archeology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archeologist help us to study the past. We can know about how they lived, how they worked, and the things they used.

Again, I hope you enjoyed my essay.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BY: ADAIR STILL!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022131441	927	2		20131022141701	535	2

For example the <b>Skim Shovel </b>it has a flat edge to be able to dig easily through the rough dirt. Also it won't brake things because it doesn't have that much force. An other tool is the <b>Wisk</b> it is use by wiping back and forth against the artifact. The<b> Trowel </b>is used to slowly look at the different layers of the soil. Those are some of the amazing tools that the archeologists use!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An archeologists job is to go were they have not yet discovered about a famous person. In the passage bout George Washington it said that they didn't know about his child hood so, they went to where he grew up and dug. They found some more information about him. Also in the other passage about finding <b>Fort James. </b>They discovered that they live by the water they lived inland.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In these paragraph hopefully you learned a lot about astrologists and there very important work.

It is a very long process requiring multiple people to carefully dig up artifacts from the ground. Though it takes a long time, the results are worth it. Many sites relate to famous people or areas or even ancient cities, homes or forts. Archeology teams can be huge, lots of people are needed for delicate work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging up the past takes a long time. There can be up to 35 people on a team but still it takes years to dig up small/medium sized areas. In &quot;Digging up George Washington's Past&quot; it said that it took years to just finds some buildings. Archeologists can find interesting things, that's what makes their job interesting. In &quot;Finding Fort James&quot; it said that they found the trash that got thrown away. The archeologists have to use small and delicate tools (in source 3). Some tools include a pick, whisk and dustpan, knife, skim shovel and a trowel. Some tools were for moving large amounts of (useless) dirt with no artifacts, such as the shovel and wheelbarrow (the wheelbarrow could be used for artifacts too).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The process takes a while, but it is worth it. There are a lot of tools for this process. This process sure is important, surely not boring.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021092038	695	2		20131021095027	535	2

You can see that in 1994 it would be had to recover these interesting artifacts.

So these people figured that it would give more protection when enemy ships were near.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first objects found was not even in this century.

Their job is to find artifacts about how was it like in the past. One of their amazing discovery's they found was about George Washington and Fort James.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We all know about George Washington as a solider and a President but what about his childhood? Archeologists are finding more about Washington's childhood everyday. As we know it George lived on the property now know as Ferry Farm. His family moved there when he was just six years old. Four other houses have been build on Ferry Farm. Archeologists found burnt pottery in one of the houses, they are suggesting a fire might of occurred in the house. Along with the burnt pottery they found a clay pipe. We knew that Washington had smoked on a pipe. Now they know that this was Washington's House! We need to know about out ancestors in the past to build new items that can help us with the world today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now during that whole process of finding burnt pottery and Washington's clay pipe their is a team all behind it. Thirty-five people can be on a team and five teams each have work to do. The firsts team maps out&nbsp; the area to see whats underground and what the artifacts on a 3D computer. The second team does the digging that is called a dig. This archeologist team uses skim shovels. Skim shovels are small, flat and sharp. Skim shovels are used to remove thin layers of soil. Each layer of soil goes in a small box with 1/2 of a screen at the bottom. The dirt falls out and if your lucky you can find a artifact.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Diggers also use another process or technique called troweling.The archeologists use paintbrushes. wooden picks and small shovels for troweling.When they are troweling it could take them up to two weeks to trowel a twenty-five-square foot section. Then another archeologist team is in a lab to find out what this artifact was used for and what can it do to help us in the modern world? Its a very long process but after all that hard work its worth it! Also architects use modern shovels, and a whisk and dustpan. you never know if your standing right on a artifact! Archeologists also use a knife to scrape of dirt off artifacts. Wheelbarrows are also useful for carrying dirt or artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archeologists found another interesting artifacts at Fort James in Jamestown, Virginia, For over two hundred years people thought it had been washed away by the Pacific's ocean by its strong current and waves. But archeologists believe that there still might be some remains of the Fort. Fort James was built in 1607 where the settlers came to separate from England and start a new life. No wonder why they chose to set up a fort there. It was easy to dock ships, they thought the fort was located near the dock but near by artifacts that it was farther away that probably was a good idea so they could be hidden and protected by nearby or enemy ships. The items that indicate that it was farther away was in 1861 now about a hundred years later they started the search again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After a five year study and learning how the land was used by National Park services they finally found Fort James! They set up pegs on the ground to show how big the fort was. With all the rumors, books, and drawings the archeologists made they found out the fort was shaped like a triangle. They also found out the top of the buildings ledges were for cannons. The archeologist also found that there were dozens of burial sites and ten buildings near Fort James. Each year the archeologists found a total of a million artifacts. They found tools, armor, weapons, coins, pottery even metal toys! This place was a natural gold mine for architects!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today its very exciting to learn how people were back then. How they lived and survived through the night. How their childhood was or how they kept safe from enemies! Isn't it amazing how we are finding more and more about history everyday! Archeologist are looking for more historic artifacts today. Not just in the United States. There is still millions of artifacts that are needed to be found! So maybe when your older you can join the hunt!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	2		20131021155433	516	2		20131022111921	695	2		20131022214306	509	2

Archeologists find objects by digging. First the archeloogists map the site where they will be digging using 3D computers. The place where they dig is called a dig. Next the archeologists start digging.&nbsp; They start digging with small, flat, sharp shovels that can remove thin layers of soil one at a time. These shovels are called skim shovels. Next the archeologists put the soil in a box with a screen in the&nbsp; bottom. The soil goes through the screen but the artifacts stay in the box. Next the archeologists remove dirt from the objects. The artifacts go to a lab where another team of archeologists study them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists use many tools to do their job. These tools are a pick and shovel, a whisk and dustpan, a knife, a wheelbarrow, a skim shovel, and a trowel. A pick and shovel are used to dig close to the artifacts. A whisk and dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts. A knife is used to scrape dirt off the artifacts. A wheelbarrow is used to move things and dirt from one place to another. A skim shovel is used to remove a layer of soil wiht each scoop and a trowel is used to cut the soil to view different layers of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists help us learn about the past and how peopole in the past lived. They also help us learn more about the lives of famous peopole that lived in the past. Being an archeologist is a very interesting job.</p>	2		20131022110553	554	2		20131022203955	926	2

The first thing that they found was a set of marks in the ground.The Archeoligists found out that Fort James was built like a triangle they also found out that fort streched all the way to th river.The Archeoligists found 11 cellars, dozens of burial sites, and ten other buildings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today people find nearly 1 million objects each year!

Lets find out.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archeologists dig in places to find an object to discover more about something or someone. To find those things, they dig in the dirt with tools. The tools they use to dig are the pick and shovel, skim shovel, and trowel. Other tools they use are the knife and wheelbarrow. Lets move on to what those tools are for. The pick and shovel are for digging in the earth close to the artifacts, the whisk and dustpan are for brushing dirt of the found artifacts, the knife is for careful digging, the wheelbarrow for moving items from a place to another, the skim shovel for removing a layer of soil, and the trowel, the most common tool, which is for scraping and cutting.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a archeologist is a great opportunity to discover and explore new and exiting things waiting to be found.</p>	2		20131022130557	696	2		20131022142033	535	2

Compton,I am almost 11 years old,and I go to the 5th grade ACTS program at Woodfields Elementery School.I am writing a factual essay on the tools of an archeologist.In this essay there will be information on the many tools</p> <p>archeologists use,how they use them, even what archeologists hoped to find in the past!An archeologist's job is to uncover artifacts and/or posesions of dead/famous people.But that isn't what is going to be in this paper.This paper will include information about the tools archeologists use,how they use them, and past experiences with uncovering artifacts!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This first paragraph is going to have information on the many tools archeologists use.Archeologists&nbsp; use a lot of tools for many different reasons.The tools they use are a</p> <p>pick and shovel,a whisk and dustpan,a knife,a wheelbarrow,a skim shovel,and a trowel.Most of the tools I am going to be focusing on in this essay are the pick and shovel , the whisk and the dustpan,and the wheelbarrow.archeologists use these tools to clean dirt off of artifacts,move things(artifacts and rubble) around the dig and to dig deeper into the ground to try and find artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Next,this essay is going to include information about previous artifacts archeologists have found, how they found them and the tools they used to do it.The first past artifacts I am going to tell you about is George Washington's house.Archeologists wanted to find out more about George's early life,(before he became a famous polotician/soldier.)Archeologists have found a great many artifacts now including,the kitchen,slave quarters,stoarge houses and even the main farmhouse!They also discovered there was a fire in his house and they found peices of burnt pottery and they knew young George smoked pottery so that gives even more proof that that is the right house,(the one George Washington lived in.)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, this essay will explore information on what some of&nbsp; archeologists special tools do and why they are used.Most digs usually start with the pick and shovel,they are used to dig into the earth,close to the artifacts.The trowel is probably the most common tool archeologists use,it is used to scrape and cut to view the different laers of soil.The knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion this paper explored the many amazing tools archeologists use( some we already know about some we dont),how they use those tools ,and past artifacts archeologists have discovered.I hope in this facual essay I have typed you have learned some new things and you enjoyed reading it.Thank you for your time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END BY:MARY G.COMPTON</p>	1		20131021103002	554	2		20131021115315	223	1		20131022212910	509	1

A job of an archeologist is very fun because let me tell you that archeologist found things that were in George Washington's house years ago, but how did they find all of those things years ago. This is how. The process of digging at the Ferry Farm is a careful one.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; First and foremost, Each year, many teams will work on the site. There can be up to 35 archeologist on a team! The first team maps the area using 3D computers that can track what is underground. The imformation is recorded so that people will know what it looked like before people started digging. Another team focuses on the actual digging, and the place the team does the digging is called the dig.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, Tose archeologists start their dig with what are called skim shovels. These shovels are so small, flat, and sharp that can remove thin layers of soil, one at a time. That soil is then placed in a box with a half-inch screen at the bottom. This let's the dirt fall out while the artifacts stay in. The diggers also use a process called troweling. Troweling is when archeologists use small shovels, paint brushes, and wooden picks to remove dirt.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Third, It can take up to two weeks to dig a 25-square-foot section! Another team spends days in the lab studying the objects that are found. The whole process is slow and tiresome, but it's worth it. This means that the discovery of washington's home is important for many reasons. First, it gives the citizens of the United States a better understanding of who George Washington was before he became fomous. We also begin to know why he made the decisions he did. Another thing it does is help historians learn about the type of Colonial Americans lived. All of these things are key parts of our past as Americans.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth, Ferry Farm offers many opportunities for kids to get involved. The George Washington society runs summer workshops with both classroom and outdoor activities. Kids can explore the site, experience colonial life, and become junior archeologists. Kids can sign up for classes, games, and crafts. There is even an interactive website! It challenges kids to solve puzzles about the work being done at the Ferry Farm.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, The tools that archeoloigists use are the Pick and the Shovel, the Whisk and the Dustpan, The Knife, The Wheel Barrow, The Skim Shovel, and the Trowel. The Pick and the Shovel are use to start digs. they are used to dig into the earth, close to the artifact. The Whisk and the Dustpan are used to brush dirt off the artifacts and clear away dirt from the excavation site. The Knife is used for careful digging and to scrape dirt from around the artifacts. The Wheelbarrow is used to move items from one place to another or to carry dirt away from the excavation site. The Skim shovel is a shovel with a flat edge used to carefully remove a thin layer of soil wit each scoop. And the Trowel is probaly the most common tool in archeology. It is used to scrape and cut to view the different layrs of soil.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, People have lived on the land known as the Ferry Farm for over 12,000 years. It's location makes it a perfect place to build a home. Therefore, it's not surprising that George Washington's father, Augustine Washington, moved his family there. George was just six years old at the time. No one knew exactly where the Washington home was long gone. However, archeologists believed that the stone base under the house was still there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging around in dirt can give you more than just dusty jeans. The folks at the Ferry Farm are bringing to life the country's first president in ways we have never seen.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	N		20131018153858	926		N	20131021111007	563		N

They have a lot of work that needs to be done, they work hard to find interesting facts.So let me tell you a true story of an archeologist I have heard of.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A archeologist along time ago once discovered a interesting fact about our president. They discovered <b>George Washington</b> father <b>Augustine Washington</b>n moved into a house that was able to be built into a home . One clue they found was an old clay pipe along with many other things.<b>George Washington</b> used to smoke old clay pipes, so that is what gave it away.</p> <p>&nbsp; So now you see how hard a job of an archeologist is they have a lot of clues to solve and lots of work to do but if we haven't had a archeologist he may not know all the things we know. So next time your outside playing in the dirt and find something remember this archeologist.</p>	2		20131021190411	559	1		20131022132738	555	2		20131022221928	509	2

What would we do without our archeologists? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022083001	560	2		20131025101336	509	2

However if you want the job to be quick on finding everything, then this may not be the best job for your personality. But it never is good without you trying your best! Before you become one perhaps you should know a little about this important job you are about to encounter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Like I said before, having the job of an archeologists means that have to have lots and lots of patience. It might take perhaps a whole entire year for you to unearth a single bone or artifact! I know it does sound so terrible, however lets leave it this way. Say you are digging in a place and your quest is to look for artifacts of Abraham Lincoln. All of a sudden you touch a hard and bony thing, then you see that it is no bone but a hard and wrinkled letter from Lincoln to a close family member before his death. You have made an important discovery and you become famous! OK maybe not famous, but you have changed the world's knowledge on him forever!</p> <p>You have heard the good news, but you still need patience to do this. Without patience doesn't mean that you can't do the job. You can practice having more patience. It is hard work but worth it until the end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As a archeologists you will find lots of artifacts that are important and have not been discovered yet. There is a lot of tools that you will use to unearth artifacts to the surface, including shovels and more! This job requires a complicated list of jobs. I you even miss on it won;t be a good thing. Some of the tools include shovels to dig out stuff and be much easier than digging with your hands. Another tool is the wheelbarrow that helps you carry many things instead of going back and forth all the time! There is the whisk that helps clean fragile things and clean small narrow parts that your hand can;t reach. These are only some the tools, but soon when you have that job you will know more of the tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The job of an archeologists is hard bur a lot of fun to find knew things! I myself would love to become an archeologist when I grow up! It is a great job to dig up the past, and learn new things about&nbsp; your home , the U.S and explore its wonders.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021160057	925	1		20131022103047	559	2		20131023084017	533	2

Here are the steps to find artifacts. The first team maps the underground area with the 3D computers. They find info to find what there digging for. Another team does the digging, they start digging with the skim shovel. A skim shovel is sharp and flat. Then they use something called a trowel. It is a paintbrush or a wooden pickaxe. The last team spends days in the lab studing it but, all of the hardwork will pay off for them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021193519	555	2		20131022113925	563	0		20131022164019	533	2

They also found the kitchen, slave quarters, and the storage houses. A few years later they found the main farmhouse. I think to search at George Washington's house was a good choice because you can learn more about&nbsp; him when you search to find how their families way of life was.

So the Archeologist had to dig and find out an it turn out it wasnt washed away by a river it was still there by the river.they uncovered amor and weapons and floors and building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archeologist also is well know for discovered&nbsp; digging up George Washington`s past . Biographies didnt have very much information on george&nbsp; about his childhood so the archeolohgist went&nbsp; to dig to get more information on his childhood and where is the hoousec he grow up in at. and they think they found the house because the finally&nbsp; found the first&nbsp; building they found was the kitchen,slave quarters,and storage houses. they found the main farmhouse a few years later. at least four houses other houses have been built onthe ferry farmland ,so the digging needed to find proff that thhis was george washington house.Records shows that the Washington`s had a fire in their house. the digger`s found pieces of burnt pottery this suggests a fire occurred there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We know that Washington`s&nbsp; smoked clay pipes,so this discovery gives more proff&nbsp; itis the right house.How do the archeologists find all of these things that were in washington`s all the years . the process of digging atthe ferry farm is a careful one. some of the material the archeologist use to help them are pick and shovel ,whisk and dustpan ,knife ,wheelbarrow,skim shovel ,and trowel. finally you know what a archeologist is and i wonder do you think archeologist is interserting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	0		20131021152301	542	0		20131021154438	927	0		20131022220743	509	0

But the question is, who is going to find it? This is the job of an archaeologist. They have to first find a location, look for the artifacts, and then transport the artifacts to scientists to see what they mean and why they are significant. A lot of tough work!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to even find artifacts, the archaeologists need to find where to look for. A good place would be a place that is really old, like a sixteenth century mansion, or a cave used by cavemen. After they have targeted their location, they need to get to the location and begin looking around for good places to dig and work on.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After they perfect spot is located, here comes the toughest job that may take weeks or even months. The digging is the most significant part of an archaeologist's job and life. So first, you use a trowel and a skim shovel to get the sand or ground away. Then they use the pick and shovel and start searching for artifacts. And when they hear a CLINK! they use their knife for careful digging. The hard work is complete!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then comes the transportation. After people have taken out the artifact from the ground, light artifacts are usually given to scientists by hand. But when the artifacts are dense and heavy, archaeologists use a wheel barrow to transpot the artifacts. After the archaeologists have transported the artifacts to the scientists, the job is done!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, being an archaeologist requires a lot of work. It is not a job that can be taken by ease. But the good part is when you found the artifact and just revealed a mystery.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021190411	559	1		20131022132738	555	2		20131022221928	509	1

The information learned from these objects helps us understand how the people in James Fort lived. Now the archeologists now know how the settlers fought Powhatan tribe that often attacked them.
