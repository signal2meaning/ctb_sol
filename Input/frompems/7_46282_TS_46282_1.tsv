When the bikers are riding at night to use a headlight or a rear strobe light so others will be able to see you, follow the same laws as cars and when you have a cell phone be sure to bring it so if an emergency were to occur you have something you can call someone with. If you have headphones, to not use them when biking so they can hear around them.

Additionally, there are still pedestrians that are walking on these streets, so you could still crush somebody and get them injured.
