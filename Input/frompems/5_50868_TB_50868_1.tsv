If they talk in the halls they will not have enything to talk about in class, so it ill be more quiet in class. The other teachers can close ther doors so they can not here them. That is why i think we should be able to talk and don't have to walk in lines.	1		20130809140854	1385	2		20130809140818	1251	1		20130827120817	1221	1

Why only get the fifth graders in trouble that is not fair .  Why not punish the other grades.     I think we should put a new  school  rule . That all the grades have to be quite down the hallway instead of being the fifth graders. Who ever is quite down the hallway by the end of the month the teacher will pick who gets ice cream for being quite.

Think of it the opposite way, would you like it if other classes were talking when your were learning a new lesson, or taking a test, or reviewing a topic?

I also think that students should always havemanners inthe hallways like if someone is trying to get past to let them trough escpecelly the older kids.     This school rule is air and should be a good rule for the other students. The only problem with the rule is that the other studentshould have the same rule not just the fifth graders. If the fifth graders have to walk in a straight  line then k-4th should too. Because if the 3rd graders walk down the fifth grade hallway not in a straight line and talking then they are not doing their part but the fifth graders are.	2		20130809140856	1385	1		20130809140832	1161	2		20130827120816	1218	2

It is also not fair because everybody should be quiet in the hallways, not just the 5th graders. This is also unfair because, 5th garders are the least mature of the whole school. The other more mature students should be able to talk in line.  This rule is fair because 5th graders talk the most out of the whole school, and they should limit that. They should be allowed to talk if it is some thing academic, they should not be tralking trash.It makes sense to have a meaningful conversation. But people do not know how to value creativity, so if someone is talking about an idea that can change the world, and they can do it, they should not limit talking about that. Now I will go a little off topic, RAISE STANDARDS, THEY ARE TO EASY, in science yes.

If the fifth graders are making too much noise in the halls they should be quiet. If the teachers complained then the students really should make an effort to be quiet in the halls. They should keep in mind that other classes are going on, and you never know when someone might be taking a test.           The fifth graders should also walk in a straight line. You are never to old to walk in a line. A little first grader could be walking down the halls. If the fifth graders weren't in a line they could accidentally hit that little first grader with their bookbags.

I think fifth graders can walk in the hall way hands to them selves and they should be quiet.I get a little mad when classes are walking by the room making noise when i am reading AR or taking a test it stop me from thinking my ideas for the test and it losses were i am in the book so then ill have to go back to a place in the book and find were i left off.I know i can walk in the hallways hands to myself without disturbing class rooms i know i might get in trouble if i am talking to some one and diisturbing classes and if i am talking to a friend for a very long time i will be late and i will get in troble.When i usually take in the hallways it Ecos around which makes it louder and it will disturb a class or make me late.And sometime teachers might give you a detention from being to loud or being to late and at our school you will miss and you won't get to go out side.Thats why i say you don't really need to walk in a line and you should be quiet as possilbe. :)	0		20130809140822	1218	2		20130809140829	1165	1		20130827120805	1251	0

Recess you can talk play and do whatever you want at recess you can also talk there and not in the hall ways. Kids need to learn as much as the fifth graders and how are he going to do that if they cant even concentrate. If you walk down the hall loud as ever and the teacher closes the door thats just embarassing. That rule is respectable for all theese reasons.            That rule is important and it is fair its not the teachers fault the fifth graders want to talk and act like fools.          If the teachers arnt doing anything to the fifth graders they are gonna think they are off the hook and they will get away with it all the time. If the fifth graders didnt get punished students and  teachers wont be able to concentrate or think. If something like this wasnt tollarated all the classrooms connected to that hallway would probably fail just because some of the fifth graders dont know how to be quiet.They made a rule to stop all that from happening so ya it is fair. If the fifth graders would have been mature it wouldnt have to be like that. These are some reasons why i think this rule is fair.	2		20130809140814	1221	2		20130809140840	1161	2

I think this because 5th graders shoud be able to walk in a line and be quite for a short amount of time. If kids can not do this that means they probably need more discipline and to listen to instructions. 5th graders should already be getting less loud when they walk by another classroom.  When other teachers come and complain about the class of another teacher to to that teacher it does not make the teacher of the 5th grade class feel good and proud of their class like they should. Teachers should never have to wait, yell, shout over voices, or tell kids to be quiet. Kids should do this automaticly.	2		20130809130808	1165	2		20130809130800	1221	2

Though at our school we have to walk in a line, I think that they should trust us more and let us walk quietly in groups. If the noise is disturbing other classes when they don't walk in a line, then, the teacher should let them know. You want the students to be aware if they are loud or not loud.  In my opinion, fifth grade is too old to be walking in a line still, they should have the trust to walk in groups. I do understand why teachers might choose to have their students walk in lines; but, I do not think that they should have them do that. The fifth graders now might think that they are not trusted by their teachers and that they are not responsible, even if they are good students. they will learn to be quiet if they get the trust to walk in a group, not in a line.	2		20130809130837	1218	2		20130809130839	1385	2

Also, that way the other classrooms that had learning students in them would be able to continue with their learning and stay focused without being distracted.  Also, that way the teacher can see all of the kids if she looks back rather then having to look all around her to make sure that everything is okay. The fifth graders do make a point when they say that they are to old to walk in lines and that they are responsible enough to talk quietly while walking in the hallways.  Though from experience I know that there are always going to be a couple of kids that cannot be responsible enough, there always are a couple kids like that.	2		20130809130841	1385	2		20130809130853	1216	2

I think it is unfair because making a straight line is useless because people will just cut you. plus if you want to talk you can do it quietly.

If they're going to use that rule It should be for the whole school not just for one grade.   The second reson is that classes should shut their doors so they don't hear us. If they don't want to be disturbed close their door because the door is very hard to hear through so, you wont hear anything unless the door or window is open.

I no that fifth graders are more than capable of walking in a straight line.Also they are not to old to walk in a straight line, grownups still walk in a straight line.  I firmly believe, that they should not talk in the hallways because disturb students that are learning.Next, they are also enterupting the teacher and causeing distractions. Thats rude. Also what if you were in one of the class's that where getting enterupted.Wouldn't you be mad at the fifth graders because I know I would.So thats why the fifth graders shouldn't talk in the hallways.You know what they say treat people the way you want to be treated.	2		20130809130814	1385	2		20130809130851	1161	2

There are some things that would make not talking in line  or in the hallways be weird.First of all, it can kind of nerve-rack people with all that silence in the hallways and not being able to walk in clusters so you don't bother anyone you don't like.It can also make kids feel like they don't have enough responsibility to take care of themselfs and can akwardly make them feel like they are not in any importance and is a baby that needs someone to take care of them which is not what they want or what you want, right.So, that is why I do mot agree about this rule that 5th garders can not talk in the hallways and has to walk in single-file lines.	2		20130809130849	1385	2		20130809130854	1165	2

If the fifth graders are being to noisy and disruptive they should have to take the priviliges to walking side by side and talking away. At the same time I think it is unfair because fifth graders are old enough to handle them selves. If they are a little to loud a reminder would just be enough. The kids who are loud and disruptive in class and in line should have to stand up by the teacher, instead of taking everybody's priviledges away. My math teacher is the one who takes my class down to lunch. She has a rule that if your're talking you have to go back to the classroom and walk back silently. I think that that is a good idea because we have a lot of loud kids in my class. All three of my teachers have a different rule about us walking in the hallway, so I think different teachers should have different rules instead of the school has one big rule.  Like I said taking privledges away is a good idea but not for everybody. Also having different rules for each teacher is another good idea. to be truthfull, I would perfer having priviledges taken away from everyone, because I don't like it when classes walk by our class really noisly so why should they have to listen to it either. Thinking about this it makes me think about the golden rule: Treat others how you want to be treated.	2		20130809130801	1385	2		20130809130827	1221	2

Some kids could run in the hallways, but they can't do that in a line. Socondly, some kids might obuse that power and get loud. Lastly some kids might not pay attention and run into someone in another line.         My opinion is I agree with the new rule. I agree because because I've seen people not be able to walk freely. Some people may get in trouble if they get cought being loud or noisy. Finally, it is not safe to run out of line in the hallway.	2		20130809130814	1385	2		20130809130839	1251	2

I know that most fifth graders are very responsible and can be responsible enough to talk quietly.  Walking in the hallways can be loud and obnoxious, but I don't think walking in lines would help with that.  A better idea would be to keep reminding the students to simply talk and walk a little quieter.       Walking through the halls is one of the only ways to get to places like the office, and I know teachers like to keep their doors open.  Ift they are bothered by students, then putting them in lines wouldn't help with the problem.  Kids can still talk loudly, and the stomping will just be more organized.  Simple reminders is a much better idea than this unfair rule.	2		20130809130853	1385	2		20130809130855	1221	2

When the student wrote ""Also fifth graders cannot talk in the hallways of the school"" I felt very bad for them because when will they get to talk? This is also not fair because only the FIFTH graders have to walk quietly in a line. I think it would be a little more fair to make all the grades walk in a quiet line.  I also think this rule is fair. Children should have the right to learn in a quiet environment. The noise disturbs other students who are learning in their classes, so the rule is fair for those students because they get to learn, but also not fair for the fifth graders because they don't get to talk and have fun. Another reason I think the new rule is fair is because people could (if they get headaches from the noise) get less headaches. It is fair because students need quiet when they study, learn, and read."	2		20130809130807	1385	2		20130809130842	1221	2

The fifth graders said that they are too old to walk in a line. Well maybe they are old enough but they are still immature.     If they were responsible in the first place then their teacher wouldn't have come up with this new rule. When the fifth graders are talking in the hallways it disturbs the other students mind. The reason they are in school is to learn and not to chat. The fifth graders chatting can be responsible for interupting every students time to learn .	2		20130809130859	1385	2		20130809130806	1218	2

The teachers should trust the fifth graders. The students who talk out of conrol should get punshied. The teachers should still let the students walk out of line, but they will be more strict about it.If the teachers make the new rule then the students might act bad and then it will just create a problem. The students are thinkg badky about the rule and they think it is unfair.     The students aren't perfect and won't be dead silent all of the time. Teachers don't give the students that much time to talk besides rescess. All of the teachers say that you shoud talk after school, but with all of the students homework and activitys they do the don't have time. School is most if the day and after school there isn't much time left. That is why I think the the new rule is unfair.	1		20130809130847	1385	1		20130809130851	1218	2		20130812130802	1221	1

I think every now and then about how it would be like not to have to walk in a line. I've had enough expeirence that most kids from 5-12 graders like to pick on each other, witch, for example, brings me to this. If we have to walk in a line, like I said we like to pick on each other, would most likely step on each others shoes, mainly on purpose.	1		20130809130827	1385	1		20130809130859	1251	1

This may cause prevention of children learning in there classrooms.  Though, whispering is okay as long as it is quiet and under cintrol.     Also , in our school, you can easily get lost by not walking in a line because  there are usually more than one class walking down the hallway at once. Not walking in a straight line may very well cause children getting mixed up  and ending up with a different class.

It's not fair that the fifth graders have to walk in a line and have to be quite in the hallways. Two reasons why I think  the new school rules should change are the fifth graders are too old to walk in a line if they just have to do something and they can talk a little bit.   First off, the fifth graders are too old to walk in a line every single time that they are in the hallway. It's not fail that they are the only ones who have to do this. Sure it might help, but what if two girls are talking side by side and they just forgot the new school rule. Are they going to get in troble just for talking an walking sise by side?  One the other hand, the fifth graders should stay in a stright line to let other people pass by. They should also not talk in the hallway becues, they might be desrating the other classes. But, the rules are still not fair.  Second, the fifth graders should be able to talk a little bit in the hallway. Just if they are quite engouh. It's not fair that the fifth graders are the only ones doing this too.   Over all, it's not fair that just the fifth graders have to do this and the new rulesare not fair.	2		20130809130803	1385	2		20130809130811	1251	2

Every fifth grader deserves to be a little more free than walking in line like kindergarteners. Older kids are responsible enough to walk freely and be quiet. Plus, why just be the fifth graders? Why don't the other kids have to walk in a line. It would be unfair to the fifth graders.	1		20130809130858	1251	1		20130809130854	1385	1

So, i kind of thik half and half. But, i understand why we should have and keeo the rule.	1		20130809120836	1251	1		20130809130811	1385	1

It is also fair because if the students arn't in a straight line the students would be all over the place! They would be bumping into eachother, knocking eachother down, and alot of people would get hurt.    The rule might not be fair because some people don't like walking in a straight line.

It would be really hard if your taking a test and the fith graders were making to much noise and you couldn;t focus on your test because of it. If the fith graders think there so reasponsible enough to talk quitly down the hall then why are teacher complaining that there to loud in the hall.  The should waik in a line because if there was an emergancy and they couldn't get through because the fith graders are scatered in the hall it would just be hard to move.

Another thing is if there not in line than people whould get triped.If there not they could probly push and some people do not like that so it could turn into a fight if every one is pushing and shubing.If soeone seems to trip and fall there fingers could get smashed and they could break therre fingers.Thats why that is a fair rule they could get hurt or destract the other students.	2		20130809150846	1385	2		20130813080834	1251	2

And anyways, walking throughout the hallways is VERY QUICK! I know that you are thinking about the teachers and how they are complaining, but I bet you that if the treachers were kids again, than they would do the same exact thing that we are doing.       I also do not agree on the straight line 24/7. We should have straight lines while our teachers are walking us to class. But when we are switching classes? NO! That is not fair because.. as I said in the paragraph before this... that students NEED time to talk and let out what they learned for 5 seconds to their friends who might not be ikn the same class as you. That is why I think that this so called ""new rule"" should NOT be permitted"	2		20130809150836	1307	2		20130809150839	1218	2

If some teachers are complaining of how fifth graders are noisy and should walk in a line it is probaly because they think they are being noisy.If they are disrubting other classes that is not okay being other classes are learning and if they are being noisy then they get foucaused on what ever is happening outside and pay attention to what ever they are being taught. So that's why i think that is a good rule.     The school rule is unfair because maybe the fifth graders are being noisy and maybe they can fix that they can be quiet but, the teachers don't belive them.It is also unfair because all the grades talk not just the fifth graders the whole school talks and don't walk in a straight line when they are walking down the hallway.

This is my opinion. It doesn't matter if your to old to walk in line. It doen't matter if you think you are responsible enough its fair. Here are some of my ideas to help you know why its fair.          One of my ideas why its fair is that all kindergardeners,1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders have to walk quietly and in a line in my school. It is true that noise can distrupt students because, a class disrupted some students and they couldn't concentrate. Also, it is fair because its not fair to those student who a working hard and a class comes and disrupts them. This is why i think the rules are fair.	2		20130809150831	1541	2		20130809150837	1307	2

For example, if they are counting something and hear kids talking in the halls and it echos they might loose track. The rule can also be a safty rule so when the kids are walking down the stairs people can help them up if they fall.	2		20130809150855	1251	2		20130809150854	1218	2

However I do not agree because if other students cannot learn because fifth graders are being loud in the hallways then I think fifth graders should have to follow the new school rule of being quiet in the hallways. I also think it is fair because the younger grades have to be quiet for us we should have to be quiet for them otherwise it would be unfair for them.       However I do not understand why our line has to be straight and single file because a not straight line does not stop a class or classes from working or learning. As long as the fifth grade and other grades learn that have to be quiet in the hallways everything will still be under control. I think as long as the fifth graders learn they have to be quiet the school will still be a safe learning environment.	2		20130809150836	1251	2		20130809150817	1385	2

If the new school ule wasn't made then a lot of kids wouldn't be able to focus on their work.Also the studens shold follow the rule because then it would help other kids focus on their work and walking in a straight line sets an example for the little kids.they should also just be quiet on their own without being told because they are fifth graders and not in first grade.that is why I think the new school rule is fair.	2		20130809150828	1385	2		20130809150857	1161	2

I'm happy that you guys are making a new rule but sometimes kid can't follow the rules and if some kids talk the whole class gets in trouble. I'm sometimes talking but thats if i dropped my pencil or something or i don't know what to do.That is my opinion about the new school rule.	1		20130809140849	1385	2		20130809150816	1251	1		20130827110828	1221	1

I think this is a good school rule because it would teach kids to be more responsible.

First of all, fifth graders have a lot of time to talk at lunch and recess. Some fifth graders even talk during class. So, they have plenty of time to talk at other places rather then in the hallways.      Second of all, fifth graders wouldnt like it if loud students walked by their class. It would distract them from doing their work which could cause them not to finish their work. It would also disturb some of the fifth graders. If someone does somthing that you dont like, then why would you do it back to them?	2		20130809140834	1385	2		20130809150810	1221	2

I also thin it is a good way to be a rollmodle for the teachers and the other kids. Kids who don't like it can just go with it because, if you don't talk  the rule may stop if you just be quiet in the halls.Tell the kids to behave or they have to follow the ruls more.    Then i don't like it because of the stuff you have to do in  the hallways  is being mean  because you can't make people do stuff that way . If it was at my school you would hae to stay in for recese.

I think that if the students really are being to noisy, then they should have that rule. If the 5th graders think that they can keep thenselves under control, then they should let the 5th graders try. If they get noisy again, then the 5th graders should walk in a line.  I also, however, think that this rule is the most fair option. Students can often get out of hand and get too noisy. If in a line, everything is orderly and peaceful. Students and teachers do have to work, and things will get done faster if it is quiet. For these reasons, I think that this new rule is fair.	2		20130809140800	1221	2		20130809140802	1385	1		20130827110819	1251	2

They should not talk in hallways because that is what recess is for.  Kids should respect the new rule because if people talked in hallways while you were doing a test I think you would not focus.  the teachers aslready have enough kids to worry about do not make their job harder than it has to be.  Fifth graders should have the responsibility to show their teachers they do not talk in hallways.   Walking in line in the hallways is a good rule because it gets fifth graders ready for sixth grade.  The rule should have been introduced earlier in the year.  Kids should not complain just because teachers are inforsing a new rule.  When they know the rule is fair.  Fifth graders should follow the rules.	2		20130809140835	1385	2		20130809140829	1218	2

I think it is fair that fifth graders are suppose to be quiet in the school hallway, because other students may be taking test and mess up on it. If students are talking in the hallway kids may not pay attention to the teacher and miss important information. Most of all if you are talking the hallway you may get yourself in trouble.       Students should walk in line no matter old they are, because if they aren't they may bump into someone else and could cause an injury. If students don't walk in line they may get lost on a fieldtrip in the woods or a zoo. Even if a fifth grader doesn't walk in a line they can lose a game or something very important to you.

I strongly agree with the new rule because their are  tons of classroom doors open all day long and it is disturbing and rude to interupt a classes learning time. It's also very rude to block the hallway, which could happen if students aren't standing in a straight, queit line while in the hall. I belive the new rule can help make a better school because it will always be quiet and not a hudle, which will make it a peaceful school.	2		20130809140809	1385	2		20130809140822	1541	2

I think This rule is unfair because when other grades are loud fifth graders just have to deal with it. I think fifth graders are also mature enough to be quiet in the hall. If other grade levels are loud then why can't fifth graders?        If certain fifth graders behave real loud than punish them not the innocent students. Some students can just not handle being quiet so maybe let them talk quietly in the hall. That way that situation is a win win. You can also give them rewards for this behavior so more kids will enjoy doing this action.	2		20130809140851	1541	2		20130809140828	1221	1		20130827110859	1251	2

If they stand in a line it might be more difficult because alot of people cutting in line and pushing and shuving to try to be first. It would be more dangerous to stand in line because when people that are pushing and shuving can ingure someone really bad. If you take talking in the hallways away that would be bad because maybe thats the only way they get to talk to there friends in school. walking in a strsaight line would be probably difficult for the teacher because there would probably be alot of people going into there class saying that this person did this and that. thats my opinion on the new school rules.	2		20130809140843	1385	2		20130809140804	1307	0		20130812120821	1221	2

Now I think if they would talk in the hallway then it would be fine and if they didnt take it responsible then to take there talking away. Then I do think it is fair that they have to walk in a line even though they are older. They would take up space if they didn't walk in a line.

So if your to loud you will lose foces. But some student say they will be quiet but they start getting even louder. So it is kind of far that we can't talk in the hallways.  Some people are quiet but the other people around them are loud so they get in trouble to. I don't think people should talk in the hallway at all. It disturbs when people pass you or when your trying to learn but you can't pay attenction. It might not disturb you but it can  disturb the people around you if they like to be quiet.	2		20130809140837	1221	2		20130809140821	1165	2

In my opinion fifth graders should not walk in straight line. The line would just be in a twisty position and you would be able to hear whispers up and down the line. Students should be given a chance to prove themselves worthy of the things they want. If they don't have a chance they will rebel against the school.     Fifth graders should not follow this new rule they will feel like preschoolers and if they feel that way they act that way. I would want the fifth graders acting like adults rather then drooling preschoolers. I myself as a fifth grader would rather be treated as an adult.	2		20130809140836	1165	1		20130809140814	1251	2		20130827110814	1221	2

I do agree with the rule that you need to walk in a line in the hallways until you get to a higher grade level. I think this because if you didnt walk in a line when you are at that age somone could trip and fall and hurt themselves or the other people around them because they would of run into them. I do think that you should be able to stand who you want to stand by in line and make it still corospond to my first rule about talking in the hallwaysAgain if you are being diruptive in line i think you should have to have a line order spot with somone you will not talk with until your teacher thinks you are mature enough to go back to being able to go back to being in whatever spot you want in line.	2		20130809140822	1161	2		20130809140837	1218	2

It should be that they get to not walk in lines and quietly talk while walking to a different class or related art or lunch. If they walk in lines they wil still be walking in lines in middle school. So students in 5th grade should'nt be walking in lines to everything but still walk in lines to some places. If we walk in lines we won't be prepared for middle school at all. So 5th graders should'nt walk in lines.	1		20130809140824	1218	2		20130809140808	1216	1		20130827110817	1221	1

The talking could have been controlled by us, but the teacher never told us to be quiet. So by that I think it is not fair that they should pt this rule.        Also I think this is not fair for us because 5th graders are gonna take forever to actually get in a straight line. That is wasting valuable learning time. There is also the no talking and that is not fair for us because think how long a child could go without talkin Like 5 minutes without talking.

As a 5th grader I know that between classes are the only time we get to talk. what if somebody get hurt how do we get help without talking.  My second reason is that walking in line is really pushing it. We know how to walk and we know what a line is bur if nobody else is in the hall why can't we walk where every we want. I s it going to kill somebody if we walk out of order. I am pretty sure 5th graders are capable of not falling down while walking because it takes skill to trip on flat spaces.	2		20130809140815	1385	2		20130809140810	1221	2

I think this because the students who are in their classroom need to concentrait on what they're doing, so they don't miss something important. Also, even if the students think they're talking quietly a lot of times they aren't. I know this because a lot of times I'll be walking from one class to another and my friends will be talking very loud, and when I tell them they say they were whispering. Lastly, kids should be in a strait line because then other people will be able to walk in the hallways without having to worry abut getting trampoled.	2		20130809140802	1385	2		20130813080858	1218	2

The fifth garders who say that they are too old for waliking in line are right, fifth graders shouldn't have to walk in line anymore. And there are some responsible fifth graders and the are some not-so responsible students who ruin it for others. It would also not be fair to not talk in the hallway  because students should be able to talk to their friends and have coversations with others without getting in trouble.I know this because some students in the fifth grade at my school don't know how whisper or talk quietly so other people get in trouble because of  them.    If you hear someone talking in a loud voice tell them to quiet down or talk in a softer voice. 5th garders should also be responsible enough to apologize to the classes they disturb. As you can see, I think the fifth graders need a second chance for walking and talking in the hallways.	2		20130812080859	1541	2		20130812080839	1218	2

And even if the do talk, all the classroom doors can be shut so no noise gets in. Another reason is because, yes, we all to old to be walking in straight line. If we go somewhere in the school, we should be able to just walk down, instead of being all fancy like, and walk in a ""orderly fashion"", or in, ""single file"".   This is why I think that 5th grade students should not have this rule all the time, and to just walk down the hallway like how kids do it everyday ay school."	2		20130812080856	1218	2		20130812080802	1251	2

I think that its a good idea because we can show better respect for other students in this school.we do need to be  quiet because other students are doing things important in their class to.Also we could show other student a good way to act in the hallways.

It is very fair because maybe the teachers are right that the fifth graders are noisy when they walk down the hall and it can disturb other students when they are learning. If students dont like this rule they may show that they are responsible enough to be quiet when they walk down the hallways. Besides, it really isn't hard to be not talk just for a few minutes or even seconds. Plus it will be easier for the teacher to teach.              Walking in a line isn't that hard either. Students can walk in a line with no problem because it isnt hard.

To be perfectly honest i would hate it. So everyone should be respectful anb walk in a line whenver th whole class is in the hallway.      I think the new school rule is fair. I think it is fair because to the classes that are being iterupted they are their to try to learn and when that kind of noise is in the hall it can be very distracting. Another reason is because if we had parents in our school they don't want to think that they are rude. Everyone should walk in a line so if two classes try to pass on another in the hallway it could be a mess.	2		20130809160802	1161	2		20130809160837	1385	2

The rule is also fair because if we run it wiil sound like a stapead.Thease are the reson how the rule is fair and not fair.	1		20130809160801	1218	1		20130809160834	1251	1

I don't think it is fair because we are old already and we are older than the lower grades, so they should walk in a line. We should be able to talk, if we can't talk then whats the point of walking out in the hallways with your friends. When we are in class, then lower graders will talk and make a lot of noise and disturb us too.              My own experiences is that when I was in class and the lower grades has recess they made so much noise I couldn't even concentrate. It drove my crazy. They were all screaming and laughing. When we have recess the lower grades are in a different area, so they can't hear us that well. Upper grades are more mature than lower grades.	2		20130809160827	1161	2		20130809160807	1221	2

Fifth Graders are able to stay mature and walk in circle's as long as they don't get to class late, they shouldn't have to walk in straight lines. They just have to not make a lot of noise and then they will be able to walk, because there is no reason for 5th Graders to have to walk in a straight line. It is uncalled for. It just makes no sense. None.  I also don't think it is fair to make kids not talk. In between classes is the only time kids can talk to their friends because, in most classes, you are not able to socialize. If teachers have a problem with kids being to loud, then they can come out of their classroom and ask them politely to quite down. And if that isn't enough than you can make them be quite while they walk by, but it is completely unfair to make them walk in straight line and not talk, its just not fair.	2		20130809160803	1385	2		20130809160836	1251	1		20130812150801	1221	2

When your in line and can't talk it is calm and they won't disturb other classes.   When your in line it's nice and quiet and nobody talking.

Like what if their was an emergancy and Mrs.Vanmenter was running down the hall she couldn't get through.  Also because once we be good we get to do fun things. And I no the teachers like it when we behave and be good. We will get to talk to Mrs.Vanmenter if we do bad things and get yelled at and not good things happen. But if we be good in the halls we can talk to Mrs.Vanmenter but about the good things that weve earned. So I like the ideal alot.	2		20130813080841	1251	2		20130813080824	1541	2

If people passed by the fifth graders classrooms making a lot of noise they probably couldn't pay attention. So, why do they think being noisy doesn't affect the other classes learning skills, too? Also, some other kids may have trouble paying attention in class. So, when other kids are making a lot of noise outside their classrooms they will become distracted and won't be able to learn.    Another reason why I think the new school rule is fair is because some fifth graders think that they are to old to walk in a line but, I don't agree. Some teachers may find it easier to keep track of their students when they are in line. This way if there ever was a fire or a tornado, etc.,they will be able to get them to safety faster. Also, in lines kids can get to their classes faster because they could fit more people in the hallways.

Sometimes, when I am working in my classroom, I look out the door and see a line of fourth graders quietly passing our room, going to art class.  I do disagree about the rule that we have to walk in single file, because once we are in fifth grade, I think that we are mature enough to walk with who we want to while we are in the hall.           It is human nature to talk to another of our kind, but sometimes we have to rein in that instinct.  Being quiet in the halls is good practice for times when it is mandatory not to speak, like at a wedding or funeral, or even just in class.  Also, if you are quiet, you will not get yelled at by teachers who want you not to disrupt their class.	2		20130809160825	1385	2		20130809160813	1307	0		20130812140832	1221	2

I believe they should not have to walk in a line.	1		20130809160846	1251	1		20130809160834	1218	2		20130812130805	1221	1

Because if they aren't talking and not taking up to much space then it's not making a distraction or anything. I mean we aren't at a military base, we don't have to be in a perfect line.  That's my opinion and I think that's pretty resonable, I hope you agree.	1		20130809160804	1385	1		20130809160825	1251	1

It is totally fair that the fifth graders must not talk in the hallways so they don't disturb the other students. Otherwise I belive that the fifth graders should be aloud to not have to walk in a line as long as they aren't to noisy. The teachers probably made that new rule because of the noisiness in the hallways tht was disturbing their classes. Maybe if they showed the teachers that they can be quiet with those privileges that they had before they can get those old privileges back or get another chance with them.  This new rule may also seem unfair to the other fifth graders because they didn't relize what they had been doing wrong but I bet if they were shown some old security camera footage they may relize how noisy they had been. Then they might work on fixing it and maybe earn that privilege back. Also back to the walking in line rule no matter what format you're walking in it will usually make the same amount of noise. The simple noise of the footsteps that can't be helped. This new rule is only parshally fair for these reasons. That is what I think of the rule in my own mind though others may think differently.	2		20130809150825	1385	2		20130809150857	1218	2

I think that interacting is good for you because you can get to know you, so if there is a new kid that has no friend interacting helps to make friends.   I also think that if kids can speak quietly they should be able to talk. Another reason is if 5th graders walk in a line it's most likely that the'll feel like their a little kid.

So maybe the other classes teachers are letting them start their homework during class time and I know it desurptes me when there is 5th graders in the hall way talking.           Also I think it is unfair that 5th graders have to stay in a line and not talk. For one I'm a 5th grader  I like to talk and stand by my friends in the hall way.Another reason why it's unfair is becausethe 5th graders now might of thought when they where younger and saw the 5th graders in the hall way that when they get in 5th grade they will be able to talk and walk in a clump in the hall ways.That is why I think the rule is fair and not fair.	1		20130809150839	1307	0		20130809150801	1251	1		20130812130831	1221	1

My opinion for this school rule is that they should change the rule.Yes, I know that none of the teachers agree with my opinion but it is a good chance for fith graders learning to be responsible.If a irresponsible student is yelling down the hallways and not being quiet then yes they should recive a punishment.But I do not think it is a fair rule for fith grade students.They should have a chance to show teachers they can walk quietly threw the hallways. So in my opinion they should change the rule.	2		20130809150853	1216	2		20130809160816	1251	2

Because other kids might be bothered when there testing or doing something important.  Another is that Principal's could be outside in the halls and they could send you to the principal's office because your being so loud that the cafetiria ladies could hear you talk loud.  Teachers could hear you in there classrooms when there trying to teach something           I think the new school rule is fair no matter if they don't like it it is very important to have that rule because well students could be testing and they hear you making noises they won't get a good grade on there test and there parents see the low score he/she got they would be very dissapointed at you.  That's why the principal's could keep that new rule.	2		20130809150837	1385	2		20130809150830	1251	2

It would do nothing but cram all the students together, and it would take longer because its a line instead of just walking in the lunch room with groups of friends. It is completely unreasonable to make students walk in a line.  The no talking rule is even worse! In the first place, why shoudn't they talk in line? They already can't talk in class so why deprive them of talking in the hallways too? If the teachers think its too noisy, why do they care? If its distracting their students then its there job to stay focused. I hope they will reconsider that new rule.	2		20130809150841	1216	1		20130809150840	1251	2		20130812130856	1221	2

Some of the other students in the other classes might need to consentrate, They might not be good at school and need complee silence to be able to consentrate and do thier work. Also just because your good at school doesn't mean it take s asecond to be able to understand and if thier's kids in the holway disturbing you then maybe you don't do good on the work you are doing. Also you may be a person that has to have complete silence then if the people in the halway are disurbing you then just think you did that to the kids learning earlier. So if you make a lot of noise in the holway you should stop so you don't get in trouble, make someone mad, or make someone fail thier assinment.	2		20130809150852	1251	2		20130809150808	1218	2

It is not fair when the 5th graders are talking and the other students are learning. It's not fair because the other students are trying too learn but they can't with all the talking the 5th  graders  are doing. Students get disturb when other people are talkilng because they are trying to do their work but they can't with all of the talking.Also, the teachers are right , sometimes 5th graders make too much noise when they're walking down the hallway.       Another thing is that no matter where your going you allways have to walk in a straight line. If your not walking in a straight line you and your classmates might crash into somebody. Even if the 5th graders think their old enough to know how to walk in a straight line, they can sometimes forget. When your in a straight line and your talking to somebody that means your not paying attention to were your going. So always remember to not talk when your in a line cause you never know what's going to happen  to you or someone else.	2		20130809150835	1251	2		20130809150847	1165	2

If they don't stand in line what will happen if someone is coming down the hallway and they can't get through? And I think if they stand by eachother they will talk, and I don't think it matters who you stand by. If i were the teacher i would try it and see what happens. If they can handle it then I would let them, but if they can't i would make them stand in line. If that dosen't work I would have class jobs. Like in this situaion line leader. I would let them whisper in the hallways if they could walk quietly. But if they don't whisper I wouldn't let them.	2		20130809150840	1161	2		20130809150800	1221	2

Also you are inside you can't talk loud save it for outside and you are in a school be quiet and be respectful to others who want to learn, get good grades, and want to listen to the teacher.Now this is my paragraph on why it is fair that kids get to talk in a hallway.          I also think it is not fair and this is why, I think it is not fair because kids want to talk, have fun, and they also have a lot of energy. Also they are stuck in school in desk and have to be quiet so we need a time to talk, not adding resses. Resses isn't that long, and when you go out for resses all you want to do is run play jump and the people you talk to inside you mite not have the chance to talk to them out outside because your friend mite want to do something you don't want to do.Now that is my paragraph on why it is not fair that kids can't talk in a hallway.	1		20130809150848	1251	1		20130809150857	1541	1

Yes it can be distracting to others wo are trying to learn but, they dont need to be treated like their kindergarteners.Then again, fifth graders need to do what there told and take responsibility and teachers need to work on there own noise level because they can get noisy in the teacher's lounge and when eating lunch plus its not like they were perfect in school. They probably talked in the hallways with their friends. I mean we""ve all done it people were not perfect. So a new new rule is to be made.

Most of the students might be quiet but some might not. There are a lot of reasons why fifth graders why they should not line up by tha hallway.        There are a lot of responsable students and it is not fair to the students that are responsable. They should at least vote if they want to line up by the hallway or if they want to line up where they are suppose to line up. The more noise the more teachers will complan.

I think fifth graders should not talk in lines because other classes might be doing a test or reading. Other students talk inthe hallway can be really loud and can distract the other kids in session.           Therefore, I think fifth graders should be walking in lines because if they are not. When other class is walking in the hallway, they might bomp into each other, and that causes they to fall. It is really dangerous. If kids are walking in line, they won't bomp into each other and won't get hurt.	2		20130809150838	1385	2		20130809150833	1251	1		20130812130826	1221	2

Kids always deserve second chances and it shouldn't just become a rule. Why don't any other kids have to walk in a line or not talk?   What if when other kids talk and walk in the hallway it bothers the fifth graders? And now just fifth graders can't talk and they have ti walk in a straight line in the hallway?

So that means if their gonna do it then 5th Graders at your school should do it too. If your going to be loud in hallways then you should stop and think about how if they do the new rule right and don't disinrupt you then you should do that to not bother them. In 5th grade you should already know how to walk in a line quietly and resopniblely.     In my opinion I belive that your 5th grade class should have already been doing this in the hallway. I have had this experiene, where I thought were to old to do this. But then I relized that other kids in the school need to learn to.

I sometimes think that the teachers are just trying to make are school look persentabal, enough for students to join our school. Us kids need to learn some responsibility in our lives. And for those kids in the story to say that some 5th graders thinks this is not fair, then they must be the ones causeing the nois in the hallway.

It is fair because then, maybe, they will stay quiet and not disturb other classes. No one is ever too old to walk in a line. If I was their teacher, and they complained that they don't want to walk in a strait line, then they will owe me some recess time.

This is because some teachers complained that the fifth graders make too much noise when they are walking in the hallways. The noise also disturbs other students learning in their classrooms. However, I think this is unfair. I will show why I think this is unfair in the next paragraph.    First, I think the fifth graders do not have to walk in a line all the time as long as it is quiet and as long as they are being safe. In my fifth grade class, we sometimes do not walk in a line. For example, when we went to the Computer Lab yesterday, we did not walk in a line. However, our teacher told us to whisper and not to disturb the surrounding classes. Also, as I just said that our teacher told us to whisper when we walk through the hallways, the fifth graders should be told to whisper instead of being told not to talk. What if someone needs to tell someone something really important like if they forgot the homework they needed to finish at lunch inside the class? The next reason is that I think all the blame should not be given to the fifth graders. If they are going to make a rule like that, it should be for the whole school. I thought about it, and what if the other students are also disturbing the fifth graders? To support this reason, something that usually happens at my school is that when the fourth graders are playing outside or walking/running through the hallway, they scream and talk really loud. This interrupts the classroom and most of the times makes us close the door because it is too loud outside. To conclude, these are the reasons that support my opinion that the new school rule is not fair.	2		20130812090807	1385	2		20130812090833	1161	2

Now i do say that if the 5th graders believe that they walk quitley down the hall then i would record them walking around the school and show the 5th graders how they acctually walk and show them how loud and disturbing they are.	2		20130812090815	1385	2		20130812090818	1251	2

And if the fifth graders are talking they will be in trouble because if they are talking loud the teachers will tell their teacher and they will be in big trouble.So they better follow the rules if the don't want to get in trouble.And thats why i think it is a good rule.	1		20130812090808	1541	2		20130812090847	1161	1		20130812140848	1221	1

They shouldn't have  rules for the 5th graders in the halls because maybe when they were in kindergarten they always heared the 5th graders in the hall,so now it is there turn.I bet  you the grades kinder-4th don't follow the rules.

Walking in the hall by themselves is a great practice for middle - school. It's better to learn it early than later, by the time they get to middle - school they will know how to handle walking in the hallway. If they can walking quietly in the hallway the teachers or the principal should let them talk quietly in the hallway in a whisper voice.     Teachers say that kids make to much noise and distract the students who are trying learn in the hallway. My opinion is that noise in the hallway , will distract you and the kids trying to learn will need to learn to deal with it. I understand if there is banging on the wall, or someone screaming in the hallway then I get that the teacher or who ever is in charge needs to tell that person to stop what their doing . I also understand that those who are creating boisterous distractions should not have the special privelege that the others get to have. Overall I would say that 5th graders should have the special treatment of talking and not staying in a single / file line in the hallway. They should just remember that it's a privelege and it can be taken away.	2		20130812090807	1161	2		20130812090852	1218	2

One last reason we should let other classrooms learn is so could get good answers while they are thinking.   The new rule will make a good impressoin to the little kids. The rule will make the little kids do the same thing when they are in the hallway. It will also make the kid do the same when they go to fifth grade.Once they go up more grades the will get more and more silent in the only in the hallway but every where.

First of all, fifth graders should be walking in a straight line because all fifth graders know what a straight line is.  If fifth graders are not walking in a straight line then that shows other kids, fifth graders don't know what a straight line is and that is pretty embarassing.  Also, if you are in a group of people then that group of people could talk.  Lastly, I think the rule you have to walk in a line is fair.      Secondly, you should never ever talk in the hallways.  For instance, the talking could disturb other classes that are learning.  Also, it shows other people that you don't care if you are in the hallways or outside your still talking.  Lastly, that shows other people that you have something really really important to say.  I believe fifth graders should not talk in the hallways.	2		20130812090821	1221	2		20130812090837	1385	2

Because if the fifth graders dont walk in a  straight line and be quiet in the halls the halls will be crouded and people will bump into each  other and get hirt and if you don't be quiet in the halls you will distract people from learnig. The fifth graders also have to think about the little kids it sets bad examples for them and if they don't walk in a line and keep quiet they can get in trouble.  If you don't walk in aline then someone will get hirt and have to go home and they won't be able to learnthat day. If your not quiet in the halls other people will get distacted and won't learn anyting. So always be quiet in the halls and walk in a line so people can learn and be safe, responcible and resecful.	2		20130812090838	1221	2		20130812090836	1251	2

Think of it, yonger students will not get the education they need and it will be all the fifth graders falut, and teatchers will be very upset. Example, say that you are talking very loudly and the teatchers keep telling you that you are too loud and the fourth graders are studying before a very important test and there is no way that you can get them to be quiet and then the bad news is that you make a bad grade when you were trying so hard.   Second of all is that it will influence the other grades to start talking in the halls, it would turn into a noisefest. this will get the others thinking that ''If they can talk in the halls, so can I''. This will start to turn out like a desaster when you start to teach because you'r voice is drained out by all the noise. If people start to resepesct this school rule, then it will be a peaceful place by the time you enforce this rule.	2		20130812090810	1385	2		20130812090811	1216	2

The teachers are right beacuse if kids are talking or making noise in the hallway the teacher may get distract and stop teaching beacuse of all the noise that the kids are doing in the hallway.	2		20130812080858	1218	2		20130812080808	1221	2

And in stead of punishing the whole class you could punish the one/ones who caused trouble.Also the kids who think they are too old to walk in a line in the hall are then probally too old to do alot of things since they cant follow a simple task like walking in a straight line. I think this rule is fair because how would you like a noisey class to walk by your class room whiale you are taking a test, I dont know about you but that would really distract me and maybe even mess me up.

Also, 5th graders are supposed to be role models, so they should show an example to others. The reason I don't think the 5th graders like the rule, is because they like to talk with their friends, which is fine, but also because it is both very disruptive and distracting. If the 5th graders could just control how loud they talk, maybe they wouldn't need to use the rule.  I think the reason the teachers made up the rule is because they think that the 5th graders are too talkative and do not show enough effort in schoool. So they are trying to both help the other kids and still keep the 5th graders on task. Besides, can't the 5th graders just talk to their friends after school or at recess? It doesn't seem that it should be that hard just to wait for one hour or two. In conclusion, I think the rule is fair.	2		20130812090857	1216	2		20130812090852	1541	2

Also they should be a good example because they are older and younger kids look up to them. They can also get hurt or get in big trouble. The fifth graders should be more responsible and think of other to not just themself.  Some of the fifth graders think they are really cool to walk in line and they are setting a bad example to the younger ones and they are kind of saying "" We are to cool to do anything that the teachers ask us to do and we don't care about any of the rules and we can do whatever we want to do."" that is also not a good way to be at school. They should act more responsible and to listen to other people when they are telling them what NOT to do."	2		20130812090804	1385	2		20130812090848	1161	2

The rule also helps set a good example for younger students because they might look up to some of the older students.     If the 5th graders know that they can talk quietly in hallways why don't they do it then. They are also not to old to walk in lines because older students do and it shows a sign of maturity and responesbility to follow directions. That also helps set goods examples. Therefore, I believe the 5th graders should thoughen up and follow the rule.	2		20130812090800	1161	2		20130812090816	1385	2

But all together it's not fair because other kids won't have to follow it and they can just as easily talk loud and disturb classes trying to listen.	2		20130812090827	1221	2		20130812090806	1251	1		20130815180843	1107	2

And what if we can here the class through the wall then why would we be bugging them by talking if there yelling and screaming.And why do we need to walk in a line because its just a hallway its not like were gonna do backflips down the hall.

This is my opinion because I think  when the fifth graders walk in the hallways and are overly noisy they should receive some form of punishment. This punishment shouldn't be very harsh, but they should still receive something because the noisiness may affect the learning that goes on in other classrooms.     Even though I agree that they should be more quiet, I feel walking in a straight line is a bit unnecessary. This is because I feel a person can still be quiet without having to walk in a straight line. For this reason I agree with some of the fifth graders who say that they are to old to have to walk in a line.

The kids can't report anything to anybody without talking.   In conclusion, the rule that those teachers made up isn't safe for anyone. That's why I gave my best and most honest opinion.	2		20130812130817	1385	2		20130812130858	1251	2

Another reason is when a teacher is teaching the students should not talk and sime fith graders can talk to their friend ,but when teachers give a sheet of paper that student will not know haow todo this.	2		20130812130852	1385	2		20130812130818	1251	2

If fifth graders stand in line all the time they might not be able to see whats in front of them and might run into things, then they could get hurt and if there were fifth graders behind that fifth grader might not see him/her in trip on him/her.	1		20130812130837	1541	2		20130812130811	1165	1		20130813090827	1221	1

Number one we have monitors I don't think they should make it that strick I think the students that are very loud should be punished I think you should be able to whisper. On the other hand I do think they should walk in  a stait line so they don't trample the younger ones. This is my opinion on this subject I didn't think what other students thought on a days bases I hope you will be thinking about what I said because I'm not one of those people who talk when it is not your turn we should always have chances.	1		20130812130816	1218	1		20130812130844	1541	2		20130812160856	1221	1

The class that is walking or students walking should be quiet and respect other kids and teachers. How would they like it if they were in class and people in the hall and they were being loud and disturbing? I dont think that they would like it! I think that walking in the hall is also great rule because the people that are running or skipping or something other than walking are being loud and the floor is shaking and being disturbing. Those are both great rules to follow.	2		20130812130804	1385	1		20130812130834	1165	2		20130813090859	1221	2

But also 5th graders can be responsible and can be able to walk in halways at least quieter then kindergardeners and 3rd graders .               So I think it's fair if they're too loud and disrupting students ,but if they're  quiet then they can talk quiet. And the students acting up can't talk.	1		20130812130845	1385	1		20130812130857	1251	1

I agree with the author on how he or she said, ""The noise disturbs other students who are learning in thier classes."" Also, I don't think there is an age limit to walk in a line. According to the text, teachers claim that the fifth graders are too loud. So, walking in the halways in a line and silent is a good solution to the problem.This is why I think the new school rule is fair.        These are some reasons I think the new school rule is fair. While other kids are passing in the halls, the fifth graders could be in a clump and nobody could get passed them. Also, they culd set a bad example for the younger children. Lastly, someone could get hurt if they are all walking in a clump. Like if someone trips on someone else's shoe or something like that. These were some more reasons why I think the new school rule is fair."	2		20130812130829	1216	2		20130812130845	1385	2

If the kids can not handle it at all maybe the teachers can make a rule about not talk in the halls at all but the teachers can give the kids a chance to have self control.  Maybe the techers could have a talk with the kids about self control and what your supposed to and not supposed to do in the hallways.

You should not argue that your conversations are more valuble than other classes learning time even if you are quiet and older. You also should walk in a straight line because that prevents you from talking to one another.       In  my class we don't do a great job at walking in a straight line and being quiet even though it is a rule. We have gotten stopped many times by other teachers saying to walk quietier in the halls because other classes where learning. Our class is also by the kindergarden bathrooms, when the kindergardeners are walking to the bathrooms they are very talkitive and loud. We constently have to shut our door so it is quietier. We don't want to have that problem anymore, and that rule is what is helping the problem stop.	2		20130812130854	1385	2		20130812130845	1251	2

I think that they should walk in some what of a line but the line does not havge to be perfect. The fith graders are old enough to just stay in a group. That is my opinion of the new rules.	2		20130812130832	1541	2		20130812130843	1385	2

I don't think that people should feel the need to be loud in the hallways but I also think that just the fifth grade should be silent.  If people have to be silent in the halls, the whole school should have to do the same not just the fifth grade.  Every body should be able to talk softly in the halls.  Alomost the same thing for walking down the halls in a line.  The school should not just make the fifth grade do it, they should have to make the whole school do it.  It would be like military school if we had to walk down the halls in a line and silently	2		20130812130802	1385	1		20130812130847	1541	2		20130812160830	1221	2

It might be distracting to the students inside the class learning something new then they can't haer nad at the end they will not understand the lesson and the homework will be hard.        the other reson is that if they have a test they will get a bad grade but maybe not that bad.That wil go to the perminet records and it might ruin their chances of going to a good college and university.	2		20130812130811	1541	2		20130812130846	1385	2

Walking in a line won't take up all the room in the hallway. Also, if they are in a line, then everyone won't be next to each other, bumping and playing. Fifth graders can also do a better job than the yonger kids. They have done it a lot when they were little, so they definitly know how.   If they aren't noisy, then for, example, they can't disturb the third graders reading their books. If they are quiet, then the students can hear their teacher giving instructions. The other kids will also not listen to the fifth graders and ignore the teahcer. They also won't laugh if a fifth grader tells a funny joke. Being quiet helps the other students focus on their work.	2		20130812130809	1251	2		20130812130850	1385	2

And, when you walk in the hallway, you need to be quiet because other classes are learning, and if you're talking, they can't learn.    Walking in a straight line is something that fifth graders should and know how to do already. Some hallways are small, some are huge. Schools like their hallways to look nice and tidy. Not a bunch of people pushing and pulling.	2		20130812130807	1218	2		20130812130837	1251	2

It is also good to just have rules so things don't get out of control like that.Just because you are in 5th grade does not mean that you are to old to have manners.Maybe all the teachers would start being nicer to you.So i really do think that the rule is a good rule.	2		20130812130814	1385	2		20130812130836	1218	2

They can maybe have a teacher stand at the door waiting for them, but not walk them down the hall. It might be hard to walk down the hallway sliently, but they have to try. Fifth grade classes should walk one by one. The duty person can tell one class to go then when that class is in the classroom, she sends the next then it cycles.  The reason why I choose those three reasons is because many fifth - graders can deal with those many can't but they can try. Many fifth-graders will like theses rules. They can use these rules or not it would be better to use theses rules because if you don't you will  be fighting agasint it for years. I would use theses rules because you can still walk down they can now walk down the hall by themslef.	2		20130812130825	1385	2		20130812130823	1218	2

Students should be able to be quiet in the hallways now if there is some kids that cant be quiet then you have a talk with them and explain to them that other students are learning and that that student is disturbing them. Hopefully those students will understand and begin to be more cautious on talking in the hallway and how they act in the hallway.  Fifth graders should be expected to be responsible enough to be able to talk, i think they should make it a privlage. The teachers are still complaining, then you say to your students that a teacher was complaining and if you keep it up then you can walk down the hallway with me, Thats how i would adress it to them and see how they act then.	2		20130812130801	1218	2		20130812130810	1161	2

If perhaps we are in single file then, we most likely stop the ""traffic"" in the hallway, and people won't be so compressed. So, to sum it up I think that this rule is fair and should be a rule for the fifth graders.  I think that we can handle talking in line, but we have to whisper so we do not disturb anyone testing, reading, etc. I think that if a student shouts and/or disturbs any class he will be punished at playtime and will not be able to talk in line for the remander of the school year.

First of all it makes it easier for other classes to pass from the other direction. Lastly, it won't give the students the urge to talk to their peers.  In my opinion students shouldn't talk in the hallways and that there should be a rule that they are prohibited to talk in the hallways. First of all, if the students are talking in the hallways it will interupt the students in the classrooms around them trying to learn. Lastly, some students my think that they are responsible enough to not talk but, many students always feel the need to talk wehn they are out of the classroom.	2		20130812130826	1385	2		20130812130823	1161	2

I whold also want to give my opinion about the school I think the school is very serious about learning. I think the school rule is good for all the students because when the students in line want to concentrate the new school helped them a lot. I also think it's fair because all the people finally get the people to be quit so the people can walk without telling the people to stop being noisy.	2		20130812120848	1218	2		20130812130818	1216	2

They also shouldnt have to be a rule to have to be quiet because they could be responsible and be quiet without the rule. I think that they should be given another chance.         I also think that it could be fair because if students are doing a test and people in the hallways are being to loud it could disturb them. And if there not in a line kids can get all crazy.

Their still elementary they should have to do the same thing like the forth graders and lower.  They should wall in a straight line and be quiet.When their working the forth graders are quiet for them so they show do the same thing. If the forth graders wore not walking in a line in the hallway and beening quiet they would start to complain that they are to loud. Its not fair if they could do what ever they want because their older. So thats why i think it is fair for the fifth graders.	2		20130812120810	1385	2		20130812120840	1251	2

Though I could see why kids would want to be able to at least whisper in the school hallways, or walk in bunches with their friends, it's not about a level of maturity. It's simply about making sure other students in different classes still have the peace and quiet to get an education. When there's a bunch of other kids talking right outside of your classroom door, it's hard to concentrate, and in the end the school's only goal is to make sure students learn something new each day. It's a fair, easy rule to follow and it really isn't asking much, If kids were talking right outside of your classroom you'd want them to be quiet too.  Even if I do think it's a good rule, there could be some faults. If you tell the student to stop talking, you could just keep telling them over and over and they would never listen to you. You have to make some type of stand, such as taking away recess or giving extra homework. If you did this as a teacher, I believe everything would be fine and students would realize you can't be 'too old' to walk in a line because there's no age limit on being polite to others. The rule is fair and students should know better in the first place.	2		20130812120833	1218	2		20130812120818	1165	2

I think this because most fifth graders are eleven years old and about to go into middle school. They are not kinder-gardeners who do not know how to be civilized. They know how to behave.

I think that the new school rule is good because, you wont be disturbing classes while they are taking a test, doing a school project or learning something new. If students walk in a strait line then friendds more than likely wouldn't be able to talk to each other because one person  is infront and one person is behind them. You would probably want to be next to each otjher when you are talking, not having to lean back. If you did lean back to listen to what someone is trying to say then you will get caught by the teacher.  in conclusion I think that the new school rule is a rewally good school rule because students will then be able to concentrate in classes and not have to shut there doors and then still be able to hear the loud kids in the hallway.	2		20130812120823	1541	2		20130812120807	1161	2

And if they accidentlly hit the pricibal or any staff they would get detention or run into the hallway police.	2		20130812120813	1385	2		20130812120820	1541	2

I think its fair because talking in the hallway is just not a good thing to do. This new rule is good because walking in a cricket line is bad. Walking in a cricket line is bead because you can get hit when your walking by the door. Talking in line is not good for the students that are working in there classroom.       Next,walking in a straight line is a good thing because when you walk down the hallway you won't get hit. Also talking in line makes the kids in thje class room thinks its recess. Its not a good thing to talk in line cause also they might think its time to go home.	2		20130812120837	1165	2		20130812120803	1385	2

I think it is fair because if you don't be quiet in line then classes won't be learning because the 5th graders are making to much noise. 5th graders are old enough to walk in the hallway nicely and quiety but sometimes they give it up because they just dont want the teachers to walk with them so they won't be embarresed. Some classes might be arritated by the 5th graders because they can't hear anything from the teachers so they close there door. If the 5th graders don't walk nicely then other people are going to follow them because 5th graders are supoose to teach the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st and Kindergarden how to stand nicely in line. When the 5th graders don't walk nicelyn in line they could get busted by teachers because it is to loud. Maybe some 5th graders think it is not fair because maybe other people get to go in any line and the 5th graders don't and they think it's not fair.	2		20130812120854	1161	2		20130812120828	1251	2

Also walking in a straight line keeps you from running into each other.When your not in a straight line your more tempted to talk with your friend.If more classes are in the hallway they all get mixed together and is very crowded.

Now for the line rule my school doesn't have hallways but there are paths that are in between or next to classrooms.Some students may get out of line and the whole line gets disoriented.The class should stay in order so it can form a neat line and mostly so we won't get in trouble by the teachers.The teachers HATE an out of order class.For all these reasons I think this new rule is fair.	2		20130812120837	1165	2		20130812120819	1218	2

I do agree it isnt fair, but we have to be cosiderate to others who might still be working. To bad if you think your to old to be in a line, Fifth graders have to be the role models of the school for the younger kids.  If you whisper in the hallway you wont be able to hear, because everyone will be whispering. Then you will start talking over eachother and it gets really loud, and thats when teachers start getting mad at you for talking. Thats why you shouldnt talk in the hallways not even whispering.

If you are walking in a group in the hallways people could push you on porpese or aident and you coul get hurt. You also wouldn't be able to hear a answer or a homework asiment and then you wouldnt know what to do. The rule isnt hard i mean you sould be able to walk in a hallway quietly.       You are going to have to learn to be quite in you future. I dont know about you but i dont want to be a kid acting grown-up the rest of my life. You might as well start learing and practicing now.

So I guess making them walk in a straight line and being quite is fair. The 5th graders might not think its fair because they're the ones having to be quite, but they were disturbing other classes.  It is also not that fair because it's just the 5th graders being punished and having to be quite and walk in straight lines when other grades probably do the exact same thing. So, I guess it is also fair because making one grade be quite is one step closer to making everyone be quite. Because in the future when those %th graders are like 8th graders and they walk in lines adn don't talk loudly the other students will be looking up to them and doing what they do. So i do think it is fair!	2		20130812120838	1541	2		20130812120856	1161	1		20130812160837	1221	2

The students in the classroom get distracted and look away from what they are learning about.       I also think it is a little bit of an unfair rule too because students should be allowed to whisper in the hallways as long as it doesn't get too loud and causing students to be distracted. If the class in the hallways get too noisy, the teacher can tell them to quiet down or to be silent in the halls.	1		20130812120838	1165	1		20130812120849	1385	2		20130813090833	1221	1

They could save the extra info for after school, on the bus, at lunch, or at recess.  The kids would also want to talk about what they are doing this weekend or who they are having over or going to someones house.  But kids do not want to walk in a straight line either.   The kids have problems walking in a straight line because they want to stay next to their friends. Then in the line they are sepparted from their own friends. If the kids are wanting to talk about how much fun they had over the weekend they would want to be by their friends and not in a line. That is why kids do not want to stay in a straight line or be quite in the hallways.	1		20130812120803	1165	1		20130812120815	1541	2		20130812160815	1221	1

Without a line, pushing and shoving can be a serious problem. It can cause injuries and other events. Lines also teach kids to stay organized, and to be patient. When you run down the hall, it makes noises, and sometimes kids scream and yell. Lines keep kids from running, and it keeps kids from knocking other kids aside. Lines make a good rule when it comes to being quiet.  Staying quiet in the halls also improves how kids learn and think. During independent reading time, the fourth graders come in from recess. They scream and yell across the halls, preventing us from staying focused on our books. We are forced to close the door, and yet, we can still hear the screaming and yelling. That experience is saying that being quiet in the halls will really help the benifits of learning. These rules will effect our community of learning in a good way.	2		20130812120800	1161	2		20130812120811	1541	2

Now the students really shouldn't be making that much noise when they are in the hallways. It will probably help the students be more quiet during class. Without the rule they should have been quiet anyways.    I think that the new school rule is fair because they should already be quiet when they are walking in the hallways. They shouldn't be talking because when they do they disturb other classes when they walk by. They should also already be in line because they are the oldest in the school and they should show the example to the younger kids.

This new norm isn't fair in the way that, fifth graders don't get their right to talk in the school halls, but other grades can.  Maybe, if they can work out a new rule that will be fair to 5th and other grades.  The principle, should consider the 5th graders feeling as well as the other grades.      School staff should put on their thinking cap and start to brainstorm some ideas.  An idea can be to allow 5th grade pupils to speak , but quietly in the halls.  If one person has the right to speak in the halls then so shoud the other.  In conclusion, this new rule is not fair, but if they talk this disagreement out they will be able to reach a fair choice.	2		20130812100849	1251	2		20130812100855	1385	2

Why do you need to walk in perfect lines, theres no point in walking in a line except for looking neat. I just don't think it's fair to be quiet and walk in lines because the teacher can just tell you to be quiet in the halls.      Fifth graders are responsible, they are older and can follow directions. They don't need to be in lines it's just not fair. In my opinion I just don't like being in lines because in middle school they aren't in lines or being quiet.	2		20130812100848	1541	2		20130812100827	1218	2

I actually like this rule, because the other fifth grade classes here are sometimes really loud when we are still working and they go to lunch.

My own experienes show that walking in a straight line in the hall and not being able to talk only sometimes helps. Walking i  a straight line keeps the hall organized and you are less likely to get lost. Talking in the halls can easily get out of hands.         If the talking were to get really loud then it wouldn't be fair to the other students for they may not be able to learn. By not talking you let everyone concintrate and you let them learn.

That is the time where they get to socialize with their friends. If you aren't able to walk together and talk you basically dont have any friends. You only have time on weekends to go over to their house or something because of homework.  If they think they can talk quietly in the hallways give them a shot. Walking in a line in the hallways won't fix the problem Kids will find ways to mess around and do stuff to disobey the rule. They will try to stop the rule in many ways to try to annoy the teachers and do many other things. THat is why I think that the new school rule isn't fair.	2		20130812100858	1221	2		20130812100800	1541	2
