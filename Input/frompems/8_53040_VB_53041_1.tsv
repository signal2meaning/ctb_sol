My uncle and my dad look at them and instantly throw up a white flag showing that we surrender and the leader comes toward us. He says his name was Kublai Khan and welcomed us with a gold plate with a stamp of his face on it. He told me that he would love to here about us and would let us trade all throughout is kingdom with no harm from his people or his soldiers. He let us feast at his castle before he let us travel. Then we were off and free to write down all about Asia. Asia was a beautiful continent with many great spices that will make me the richest man in Europe. I went back to Kublai Khans castle and he told me,""The Mongols were originally a group of nomadic tribes who roamed the area north of China that stretched across Asia."" I told him that his father was a great man who made everything possible. I then went back to my old country with my books about Asia and also with all my spices. I was gonna become the richest man in Europe when I got arrested and I lost everything except for my books. I got out of prison and told everyone how I traveled to Asia and it was a great place with many spices. I am Marco Polo and there wwill one day be a pool game about me."
