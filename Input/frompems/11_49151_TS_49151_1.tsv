This effectively creates an analogy which not only proliferates popular comprehension but subsequently evokes a subliminally proseletyzing manifestation in the subconscious of the audience which infers that the catastrophic implications of light pollution are on par with or perhaps even of greater impact than those of any of the analogous scenes Klinkenborg depicts including the occupation of the night as correlated to the violent takeover of a defenseless nation and the reference to the disastrous and dysfunctional post-utopian societies as depicted in science fiction films, en masse. Thus, conclusively, there are several factors of proselytization, persuasion, and promulgation which are present in the text of both the aforementioned excerpt and the original work.	1		20130820090815	1339	1		20130820090840	1287	1
