During that time, the Dust Bowl caused America to go through a dark time with dust storms traveling thorough New York, Chicago, and Boston.

378	AI-XC	20131119122100	500	500	W		N	F	605582	7	10613996	Y	46450	The effect of starting the presentation with a scene of the Statue of Liberty was that the viewer can relate to the rest of the presentation. This is because many people know about the major cities in the United States, therefore making it easier for the viewer to understand that the dust storms were all over America. For example, when the visual is used of the Statue of Liberty in New York City, most people can picture how devistating the dust storms were since they have seen New York. This is important because when people can relate to the presentation, they are more interested in the topic. In conclusion, starting the presentation with a scene of the Statue of Liberty surrounded by a black cloud of dust helps the reader to become more interested, and understand more about the explinations coming up.
