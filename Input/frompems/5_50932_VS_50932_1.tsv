It said that when he went to his uncle's house on his trip it was foggy, so each day at supper Karl told his uncle that he thought it would be better if he moved down here to Udby. His uncle told him that his home is Havndal and he should stay there. For three nights after helping his uncle harvest he kept saying the same things and his uncle answered him the same. Finally the harvest was finished and it was time for the celebration. It was that night that Karl said he would prove himself that Udby is a better place. That morning his whole routine happened the same at his uncle's house then he started towards home and saw that there was fog here too. That is when he found out home is the best place to be.
