Because of the fact that humans are creating an long artificial daytime and a short artificial nighttime, many other mammals are adapting to this new schedule. Some birds now sing at unnatural hours because of the presence of artificial light, and this also induces a longer feeding, which affects their migration schedules. Leaving too early for their migration can mean arriving too soon for their nesting conditions to be right. Bright buildings can cause migrating birds that travel at night to collide with them, causing some immature birds to suffer disproportionately. Even nesting sea turtles can be affected; They show a natural predisposition for dark beaches, but are confused by the artificial lighting behind the beach. Frogs and toads that live near brightly lit highways do ""suffer nocturnal light levels that are as much as a million times brighter than normal"" which affects their behaviors and breeding choruses.
