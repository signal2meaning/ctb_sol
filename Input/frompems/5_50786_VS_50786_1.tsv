A folktale is something that can teach you a lesson. These two words are the same thing. But mystery means that it's something suspicious or it could be something you want to find out. Mystery is the one that is different from fable and folktale.

It could be a fable but a real pedler could have gone to the city and gotten good news in real life. If it was a mystery it would have a big mystery that is the problem in the story. The problem in the story is about the pedler and if his dream is true. Fable best describes the text because it isn't in modern times, there are no pedlers roaming the sreets in my town. Also because it has no mythical creatures. I think this text could teach people things because of the different ways the pedler and the shopkeeper acted about their dreams.
