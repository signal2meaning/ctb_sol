You can play someone in tennis, run relay races, but its not like having a whole team! So there is one reason why I like soccer so much. Most of the team is out on the feild at once, doing great team work. A lot of sports require some skill, but soccer seems like news skills are always learned. Whether your passing dribbling, or shooting, your never bored! Especially out on the field! Considering you have to run a lot... its a good idea to stay fit.

Soccer is agressive but not as aggresive as football or rugby but soccer is still agressive you definately cant be a wimp. In soccer the worsed punishment is a red card wich means your out for the rest of the game. If you get a yellow card its a warning and the ref watches you for the rest of the game. After about 9 years of playing I  find it is harder to get a yellow card the a red card. In soccer you get to slide tackle and get to shove around a little bit. Last but not least you play threw everything accept thunder and lightning. I think soccer is the best sport and I deffinately recommend it for everyone if you don't like it your crazy.
