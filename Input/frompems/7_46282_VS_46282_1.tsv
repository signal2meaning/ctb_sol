For example, the seventh paragraph of ""Bike Safety"" states that we should ""obey traffic signals and street signs."" This meaning that we, as the bicyclists, should let our fellow members on the road know what direction we are headed by using ""blinkers,"" like cars. Using body language, we can let those who share the road with us know which direction we're headed. For example, an arm on the left side can mean mean that you are about to make a left hand turn. If we all follow these rules and expectations, the police officers will surely be glad, since there will be less of a fuss on the road, therefore they will have the opportunity to focus on other more important things than directing the flow of traffic, for that is the purpose of traffic lights."

Bicyclist who wear helmets have 85% less chance of having a head injury. Mountain biking is risky so you should wear protective gear, such as elbow and kneew pads in addition to helmets. Wear bright reflective cloth so that everyone can see you on the road. It's a good idea to carry water or a sport drink  while you're biking.

Police officers want bicyclists to be safe while riding their bikes out in the streets. Police officers want bicyclists to wear good, fit helmets so that if they fall the helmet wont fly off with the air and it wont move when the bicyclists are falling, hit their heads, and cause a damage to their brain. Out of 50 states, only 21 states have a law that requires bicyclists to use helmets while riding their bicycles out in the streets. It has been told that the bicyclists that use their helmets while riding their bikes have an 85 percent less of causing a serious damage to their heads. If bicyclist ride bikes out in the mountains there is a much more percent of causing damages to their body so police officers would encourage bicyclists to use more gear like helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, etc. During the day while the sun is shinning bright it is prefered that you wear bright clothes so that car drivers can see where you are and becareful while they are around you. During the bike ride it would be a good idea to carry water on your bike so that you dont dehygerate during the riding on the road below the hot sun. It is always good to ride with family members or friends but be sure if you are riding on a bike trail. there is enough space for bicyclists or other runner can go around you. If you ride at night it is safer if you have a flashlight with you or a light on your bike so bicyclists know where you are at and do not crash into you and cause an accident. If you have a cellphone it is never bad to carry. Put in your pocket or wherever you can put it in so that if you are riding with your group but somehow get seperated from them you have a way to contact for help. If there is no reason for having music playing in your ears do not have earbuds in your ears becuse loud music can cause you to get distracted and not pay attention on the road.

Another safety tip is to wear bright clothing even if there is still daylight outside this is because the more visible you are, the safer you are. Make sure you have water or other fluids with you, biking can take a lot of energy away from you and you don't want to get dehydrated. Make sure you have a cell phone with you, just incase you get lost and you need some one to come and get you. Make sure you are  NOT on the road if you are calling or texting some one move off to the side because sometimes cars go above the speed limit and will not pay attention to you, they might run you over. Do NOT listen to music while bicyling it may distract ou from your surroundings, therefore making you crash or fall and get hurt!

This means that the police want to make sure that bikers wear the correct gear so that if in an emergency, they won't be too injured. This also means that police care about the safety of drivers and non-drivers. This is because the law statesa that 21 states have some form of helmet rule 29 states don't but it is always important to wear a helmet or other protective gear such as elbow and knee pads. Police also want bikers to read this passage because it is important that people know that you should always wear bright clothing during and after a day because drivers need to be aware of bikers and pedestrians. This means that bikers should be visible to drivers so that the drivers are aware of bikers.

Bicyclists share the road with pedestrians, truck drivers, and motorcyclists. There's a lot of reckless drivers out there nowadays. Also, a helmet can help if in fact you do get in an accident. It will prevent most head injuries or have less damage to the head. It's the most important bike rule of all. Wearing bright clothing is also a good rule for bicyclists. Large cars and trucks are more likely to see you on the road. To keep enough energy while riding, a biker should read that they should keep drinking lots of fluids.
