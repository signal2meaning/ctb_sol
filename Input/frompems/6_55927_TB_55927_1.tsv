The Jews came to escape prejudice. Still other people came to escape wars. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rate and farming losses. The tradition of leaving land to the oldest son meant that younger siblings were left landless, and often came here looking for opportunities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many reasons that people came to America was that they had a harsh environment, wars, other conflicts, and poverty that forced people over. People willingly came to find jobs, wealth, opportunities, and perceived freedoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Chinese came here hoping to find riches in Californian hills. Most of these Chinese were from Guangdong, on China's south coast. There were many rebellions against the government, and endless village and family feuds. The government raised taxes, forcing farmers unable to pay them to sell their land. The area couldn't produce enough rice to feed its growing population.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Between 1860 and 1910, the population almost tripled! Almost 7 times more people lived in cities, and coal production increased twenty-fold. We got 8 times more miles of railroad track, and about six times the amount of newspapers. These numbers show that the population of America is growing.</p>	2		20131022141056	2367	2		20131022141028	2372	2

As well as the Europeans, Irish, and Germans. They fought for food. Some of men worked for food but it still wasn't enough to purchase food for their families even children, babies, toddlers wold actually die of hunger. It would be a miracle if people survived that situation. It was really hard for people to stop the hungriness. there were even worst situations other than starving.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another bad situation was back then was no freedom. Like any other people they would of liked freedom, but there was no freedom at all. Some families escaped from wars to the United States of America for freedom. So, back then there were lots of harsh situations for many people. But they just had to live with it. There are many situations they went through a lot.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then it was a whole different story. Now a days we have food, water, shelter, and our parents work to give us all those stuff we need to survive. Another thing we have is freedom.

By the time the people settled technolgy was all new to them so they had something to do. They also needed to have jobs so they can get payed. they wantwed to grow crops in America becuase wherever else they tried to grow crops, it failed. <u><b>People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to America around the 1800's.</b></u> There was also Jews who came from Germany. People aslso started coming because they can have a better life here and were they used to be at before America wasn't as easy as America is. There was about 26 million people who came to America over a 50 year period! That is alot of people who came to America. Now there are billons of people who live in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alot of people moved here because there was gold. Many man went gold minning here in America. Just by many people moving here in America transpotation improved and so were railroads and roads.It became easier building because many found many items/objects or even invented things to make it easier. By moving to America many things increased here like many transpotation and building and moving long distances. When people moved to America they figured out how to get criminals in jail or to keep bad people locked in jail so it would be much safer here in America. They also had trouble with birth effects because they didn't have and medical help but now that they live in America they are able to find products to make medicine to help with any sickness, injury, or birth effects.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Chinese people moved to California because they were able to find gold and thats what they needed. A man named John Sutter was the first one to discover gold in 1849. He tried to keep it a secret but soon enough it started to spread. 60 ships headed toward california and thats when the gold rush began. The people who were gold minning were called the Forty-Niners. After the Chinese people found out they headed straight fo California and more and more came every year. When the pople started getting gold they got alot of money and then the population of the gold started going down and then some people could pay taxes or payments so sometimes they had to sell land or something valuable.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they kept gold minning they found more int he pacific ocean. Chinese had a plan to get a bunch of gold, get rich, and return back to China. But the Americans did not exept that. China still got away from it and when they returned home they spreaded it around China and more went back to China. Every year more Chinese people came and it kept increasing and would not stop. As many years went by most of the gold was gone and many chinese people went back to china but man stayed becuase they thought America was a pretty cool place and they would stay even if there was no more gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This si why i thing many people from around the world moved to America by the products, items, objects, gold, land, food, and shelter. this is also why people loved America so much because it was better and easier than the other country, state, or city they used to live at.</p>	1		20131022141013	2363	1		20131022151055	2443	1

This happened to many people in places such as Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people immigrated to America was because of the Gold Rush. People with dreams of riches came from all over the world to try to strike it rich. Many people came from China. In fact by 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese immigrants in America. People came from other countries too. In 1849 there were more than 70,000 hopeful people in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People also came for land and food. In Europe there was a tradition of giving the land to the first born so many people had no land or money. &quot;Southern Italians also suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices.&quot;&nbsp; The immigrants wanted a new life, land, and food so they came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see many immigrants from all different countries came to America for its freedom, food, gold, and land.&nbsp; Overall by the time all of the immigrants had come the population of America had almost tripled. These are just some of the reasons why immigrants came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022141026	2367	2		20131022141022	2352	2		20131022171059	2405	3

Everyone went there to get a job when they discovered gold in 1848. It was life changing! There was nothing else that would have ever made those immigrants flee to California. But, quickly people began to feel hopeless. </b></b><b><b>Chinese migrants began fleeing and other immigrants began to flee from conflicts and poverty.</b></b><b><b> Then Guangdong,an area in China off the south coast, it's population began to increase.</b></b><b><b>The area couldn't produce enough rice to feed the people.Especially when floods often destroyed their crops.</b></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><b>Okay, their was many many people that came to the U.S. and how many records were recorded.</b></b> <b><b>People who live in cities, numbers of people not born here,coal production in tons,miles of the railroad tracks,and daily newspaper given out daily.

Since there were so many people in these countries people needed food, homes, and jobs, so they thought America could have all the things they needed. They also came to America for religious reasons (which included Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia) like being mistreated for what they believe in and other religious wars as well.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people came to America was because of easy transportation. Easy transportation meant that people could could take resources (such as silver and lumber) over a long faster distance. It also meant people could escape wars much more quickly with a smaller chance of getting caught by the enemy. Then with new inventions coming out like steam power and the redesign of printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspaper. However, the invention of the telegraph and telephone made news travel faster and less newspapers were used. Additionally, Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last reason immigrants came to America was because of the gold!In 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. 70,000, people came in hope to find the California gold along the American river. The Chinese were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. Guangdong was involved in a war between China and Britain, there were people turning against the government, and endless villages and family feuds. The Chinese government was starting to higher taxes which caused a lot of people to go broke and farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their land. They also came to America because they didn't have enough food to feed everybody especially when there was floods.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the statistics for the American population and industrial growth from 1860-1910:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE U.S. :</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>1860: <b>31,513,000</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1910: <b>92,407,000</b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CITIES:</u></b></p> <p>1860: <b>6,216,518</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1910:<b>41,998,932</b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>NUMBER OF PEOPLE BORN OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES:</u></b></p> <p>1860: <b>4,096,753&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>1910: <b>13,344,545</b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>COAL PRODUCTION IN TONS:</u></b></p> <p>1860: <b>20,471,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>1910: <b>417,111,000</b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>MILES OF RAILROAD TRACKS:</u></b></p> <p>1860: <b>30,626</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1910: <b>240,293</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><u><b>NUMBERS OD DAILY NEWSPAPERS</b></u><b><u>:</u></b></p> <p>1860: <b>387&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1910: <b>2,600</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why immigrants came to America.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022141033	2443	2		20131022141049	2372	1		20131022161055	2405	2

People were leaving their home countries to come to America with reasons called &quot;pushes&quot; that drive people away from their homes. They then came to America with reasons called &quot;pulls&quot; that attract people to a certain area. Many oppurtunities were provided for immigrants that came to America which greatly increased the population in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason that people had for leaving their own countries and moving to America was that advancements in technology provided new jobs and job spaces that needed to be filled. Foreigners saw this as an oppurtunity to start a new life. Workers were needed in factories, for farming and building on the land, and they were needed to invent things. So technically, this area of reason was basically the advancement of technology, the opening of jobs, and access and wealth.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only were people just attracted to the U.S., but they also were repelled from their own countries and displeased with certain things. In Ireland, the potato crop ceased to grow, and many people died of starvation. Some people, though, in order to avoid this, came to America. Some people left their homes because of warfare or poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, people had many reasons to immigrate to America. They were either repelled from home, or attracted to America. Many oppurtunities were provided for many people. This shows that America is a great nation.</p>	2		20131022141019	2367	2		20131022141054	2352	2		20131022171053	2405	2

But many wonder why did so many travel to America in the 1800s? In this article I will answer just that.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s with all new technology there was plenty things for people to do. There were jobs available and more freedom, and that's just what some people wanted a new life for themselves and their families. But people in Ireland came for different reasons.The Irish were desperate because all of&nbsp; Ireland's crops had failed, especially the potato crop the one they depended on the most.Also during this period of time Europe's population doubled and there was so many people that there was not enough food, jobs or homes. Italians also suffered greatly from the high amount of birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. But one of the last reasons people came to America is because in 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in California. Many people came from all over the world to seek out there own fortune or to escape from a war and high taxes like the Chinese did.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why so many people traveled to America during the 1800s because life was not as helpful and generous to them at the time as it was to America.</p>	2		20131022131004	2443	2		20131022131017	2367	1		20131024101053	2405	2

Many immigrants tried moving to different parts of the world to get a better life for them selves and for there children , to get a job and earn money, to practically get wealthy and have what they need. Sadly not all of this happened to many people more than 1 million people died of starvastion because they had no shelter , and no food.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s and the 1870s people who could raise a farm , invent , and grow food came to America in ship after ship after ship. many people had to move away for there own good because of war or there wasnt enough food and supplies they needed. Some just wanted to leave because they were working poorly and they werent getting paid enough money. More than 1.7 million people moved away to places and not all of them had a good life as they planned and dreamed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In total some 26 million immigrants arrivied in the United States over a 50 year period. They say most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. Not all got what they wanted. Many immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions all over the world , and thats what they did.</p>	1		20131022141058	2368	2		20131022141012	2363	1		20131024101025	2405	1

California hit big during the Gold Rush. Many people came to America just to go to California for the gold rush. one of those many people included China's people. During that time China was going through a rough time. Their government raised their taxes. Making it harder for Farmers to pay their taxes. It made it harder for everyone who lived in China. America was the best place to be during those times. We had everything we needed. we had everything they needed.

First, I will talk about the Source about &quot;moving to America and how others came to the land of the free. Next I will talk to you about the next Source which is the pushes and pulls for immigrants. Moreover, I will talk about the second to last Source which is the gold rush when the Chinese had moved to America. Finally I will talk about the American pop. and ind. growth where all of the numbers meet between 1860 and 1910.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I will talk about Source #1 and when every one has moved to America by ship and/or other ways of transportation. In this Source all of the people were moving to America because of problems back at their own country or fleeing for freedom and harsh environments. For example the Irish had moved to America because of all of the bad crops and failing crops, while others came for religious freedom like Jews, people from Holland and the Jews came from Germany and Russia. In total about 26 million immigrants has come to America already!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I will talk to you about the pushes and pulls for the immigrants or Source #2. This Source talks about the second half of the 1800s. This was a time of great change Industry had grew and many immigrants have arrived to Americas shores. The <b><b>pushes</b></b> of the 1800s were of life which drove the people from home like starvation, slavery, war, and many other things. The <b><b>pull's</b></b> are those features of life that attract people to America like the economy and jobs, to the freedom that America had which meant a lot back then.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, I will talk to you about source #3 and that includes the &quot;Gold Rush! Chinese move to America&quot; and this tells me alone from the title that Chinese move to America for what other then... Gold. Back then gold was discovered along the American river in California on the property of a man named <b>John Sutter</b>. Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret but people found out and they rushed over their like a pack of angry bulls. When the Chinese found out they moved to America to find gold and to escape from war in hopes to find a new home or come back to China being rich and showing off to other people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I will talk about the American population and industrial growth thru 1860 and 1910. This Source tells me all about the numbers of which happened like how many people has moved to America or the coal production. Basically it tells me this,</p> <p>Number of people in the U.S] in 1860 is 31,513,000 and in 1910 is 92,407,000</p> <p>People who lived in cities in] 6,216,518 &nbsp; 41,998,932</p> <p>Born outside U.S] 4,096,753&nbsp;&nbsp; 13,344,545</p> <p>Coal production in tons] 20,471,000&nbsp;&nbsp; 417,111,000&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Miles of railroad tracks] 30,626&nbsp;&nbsp; 240,293</p> <p>Daily newspaper 387] &nbsp; 2,600</p> <p>This is all it tells you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion this is what all of the sources tell you for the Immigration and Explanatory Performance Task like the first source was moving to America which all of the people were moving to America for freedom or food and drinks or crops. The next source was about the pushes and pulls for the immigrants while they came here if it was to escape from the slavery or religious freedom and all of that kind of things. The third source was all about the gold rush and gold was discovered near a river in California and it being on a guy named John Sutters property and all of the Chinese coming here for freedom and money. The last source was on the American population and industrial growth and the statistics on it thru the 1860s and 1910.</p>	1		20131022131033	2364	1		20131022131022	2372	2		20131022171056	2405	1

They were needed in many jobs immigrants invented the new technology. They farmed and worked in factories. Immigrants did that stuff.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The largest group of immigrants were Germans. The second largest were Irish. Before the civil war Irish came to America at and after the war. 1.7 million people came to America ,because of hungriness and they were starving. Their crop was crumbling and food was short. 1 million people passed away.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the 1800s, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungry came. More people came to Europe so the extra people didn't have enough food to feed them. So some Europeans moved to America to find work and feed themselves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people came for freedom. Like people from Holland, Jews, Germany, Poland, and Russia. Jews were mistreated. Other people came, because of what they believed and war.

During this time pushes and pulls happened to make immigrants travel or flee out of their homeland. Some came for fortune and other things. Others came to escape, hunger, poverty, religious freedom, and to find work. Here are some things that made them want to come to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first reason is because of hunger. The Irish for example were desperate because the crops had failed and there was a food shortage. More than a million people starved in Ireland. The population in Europe then doubled between 1750 and 1850. At that time not many jobs were available at Europe. So many Europeans came to find work and escape hunger. At China however Guangdong was at war with two other countries. One with Britain the other with China. Poverty also stricken for they were at war. The population was growing quickly at Guangdong, and not enough rice was produced to feed the people. The floods also often destroy the crops.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason is because religious freedom. The Jewish people who came to Germany, Poland, and Russia were mistreated for their beliefs in their homeland. Russian Jews left to escape from persecution from others who mistreat their religion. Also, from prejudice and violent attacks to them. It then made their life unpredictable of what will happen next just because of their religion.&nbsp; They came to hopefully have religious freedom, and do whatever they want with it. That is America that has religious freedom and no persecution or prejudice. This is my second reason.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third reason is because of fortune. During 1848 gold was discovered along the American river in California. A man name John Sutter tried to keep it a secret. It wasn't long before everyone heard that there was gold. That is when the Gold Rush started. Meanwhile at China poverty and hunger have stricken. That you read of at my first reason. At China they heard of gold and fortune at the mountains. So then 325 men from China came to get more fortune or Gold. So then when the came back to China they are rich. More and more Chinese came later. They soon contributed in building the railroads since they wanted jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, many immigrants came to the U.S. Some to escape persecution, hunger, and poverty. Others for fortune and work. Many immigrants came to the U.S. over 50 years. About 26 million. Still many immigrants are traveling to the U.S. They came for freedom and work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022131011	2367	2		20131022131002	2443	2		20131022161006	2405	3

The Europeans didn't want o be old what religion they had to be. So they came to America. People came to America for food, homes, and jobs because there wasn't enough of them in Europe. When people came for the Gold Rush most of the immigrants came from Guangdong,China. Some of the immigrants came for the fortune because there wasn't enough rice to feed the people in Guangdong,China. So 325 of these Chinese immigrants joined the Gold Rush in 1849. he year after that 450 of these Chinese immigrants went to California and joined the Gold rush and the number of Chinese immigrants grew larger and larger. By 1870, the total population of these Chinese immigrants was 63,000. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; All in all I hope now you can see why immigrants from Europe and China came to America during the 1800s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022131044	2367	1		20131022131027	2363	1

They came because they also wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. People from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia came for freedom because Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Some of them came to escape wars that made their lives unstable and unpredictable. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses.

Immigrants have built some of our largest cities, produced much of our food, and have invented many useful things. However people don't just move to the United States for no reason at all. In fact, there are actually many reasons to why immigrants came to the U.S. especially in the 1800's. They came from all over the world, China to Europe in search of a better life and of course, freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many nations in Europe were suffering from poverty and starvation due to the huge increase in population there. When something is driving people from their homes, such as war it is called a &quot;push.&quot; Poverty and starvation are not the only things troubling Europe at the time, many Jewish people in European countries were being mistreated very horribly. However the United States had many jobs, homes, land, wealth, opportunities, and freedoms. These are called &quot;pulls.&quot; Pulls are features of life that attract people. The United States had many &quot;pulls&quot; and very few &quot;pushes.&quot; On the other hand, Europe was the complete opposite. There were so many pushes that many people moved to the United States and became immigrants. Now, they could start new lives as Americans who were finally free from the troubles of Europe.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One &quot;pull&quot; was in the form of a mineral, a very shiny and valuable kind of mineral. That mineral would be gold, and who wouldn't want something that valuable? In 1848 gold was discovered in California, and the Chinese wanted it, even if it meant moving to the other side of the world. They began traveling to California by boat in the California gold rush. Many came from the Chinese city of Guangdong since they were suffering from many &quot;pushes&quot; such as two wars with Great Britain and poverty. By 1870 63,000 Chinese lived in the United States, 77% of which were in California. Our new immigrants even helped build the Transcontinental railroad over rugged terrain. Hopefully the new Chinese citizens found some gold so that they could start new lives in the state of California.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigrants to the United States came for lots of reasons and came from many places from all over the world. They have played an important role in making the United States what it is today. Without immigration the United States would not be very successful and many people would still be crammed into China and Europe. Immigration has also made the U.S.A a powerful and diverse nation. Millions of the immigrant's lives have been made better with the freedoms and jobs of our wonderful nation.</p>	2		20131022131037	2443	2		20131022131058	2367	2		20131024101019	2405	3

Of the many immigrants the largest group we're the Germans. Of Ireland's 6.8 million population 1.7 million immigrated to America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1750 and 1850 Europe's population doubled so there wasn't enough food, homes or jobs to go around. A lot of Europeans went to America. In 50 years 26 million immigrants came to the U.S.!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the industrial revolution transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the U.S. was completed in 1869. Resources could now reach their destination faster people could also go on these trains. New steamships in Europe could make a trip from a few months to a month. The redesign of the printing press made newspapers inexpensive the telegraph and the telephone made news travel really fast.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1848 John Sutter found gold on his property he tried to keep it a secret but word got out to San Francisco. In the January of 1849 60 ships set sail for California. 70,000 prospectors set out for California 325 men were from china. The Chinese called California Gam Saan or &quot;gold mountain&quot;.

But it wasn't because of the high birth rate. It was because the movement of immigration! People from all over the world immigrated to America because of such benifits it offered. Many types of Eroupeans and Asians moved to the U.S becasue of job oppertunities, religious freedom, harvest land, gold rushes and much more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Germans and Irish people were the largest groups that immigrated. 1/4 of the population in Ireland came because of potatos crop poor harvest. Which killed at least 1 million people. in the later 1800s people started coming from other Europeans countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Europes population doubled between 1750 and 1850 and more people means more food, homes, and jobs, but in Europe there wasn't enough. So they came to America! In america they found many job oppertunities and avoided hunger.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the 1800s there was also changes in America.Many inventions were created the telegraph and the first American Railroad, which made it easier for people to contact each other and get from place to place. Most Immmigrant came because of 1 of 2 reasons, these reasons were the &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; reasons. Push reasons are reasons to come to America because there are wars, starvation, and poverty where they would live and they wanted to leave. Pull reasons were reaseons to move to America because there is jobs, farm land, wealth, and religious freedoms. some Europeans moved because of the harsh enviroment, some jews because of religious reasons, and southern Italians because of high birth rate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Evidently there are many good reasons people would move to america in that time period, for wealth, religion, jobs, and more.

When Civil War started 1/4 of Ireland came to America. Irish were desprate because all of there crops died. Over 1 million people died of starvationtion in Ireland. People started coming to Europ and there population doubled from what it was at. People could not find jobs, home, and food so they started moving to America. America's population expended 26 million people over 50 years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first railroad was completed in 1869. It became easier for transportation and it made it easier for people to travel here. It made a huge difference for everybody you could ride a boat or train and still get there fast. That triggered impormation to, impormation was traveling really fast to. This time in the 1800s boats were and trains were really fast. Train then is like a plane.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1884 in Californa! That triggered the Chinese to come because they wanted to find a fortune. Chinese farmers that could not pay there taxs had to sell there house. They could not produce enough rice exspelly when floods came. The news about the gold spread through out China and everybody wanted to join the gold rush. The 325 who joined in 1849 was just the beggining the next year there was 450 more to join the gold rush. That seemed like the beggining to if you look at these numers in 1851 there was 2,716 and in 1852 there was 20,026 to join the gold rush. At the end there 63,000 Chinese in the United States. They could be althrough the country but 77% of them were in Californa.</p>	1		20131022121006	2363	1		20131022131021	2352	1

It's when people from all different countries came to America for a better life. Immigrants came from all around the world, including countries like Germany, Ireland, Eurapean countries like Russia and Italy, plus several more. But why would so many people leave there home and travel to an unfamiliar land?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resons why people immigrated to America are sorted into two categories, &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot;. Pushes were things that people didn't like about there country, and made them want to leave. Many countries were experiecing war, poverty, and harsh environment during this time. Some people were treated poorly because of religous reliefs. This made America the perfect place for all of these people to go, a land were they could be free and have a chance to work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That brings me to the &quot;pulls&quot; catergory. These are features that attracted people to America, an some of the pushes seem even worse. The main things people were looking for when they came to America was jobs, wich lead to wealth, food, and land. Other immigrants came looking for new oppoortunities. A very large group was atrracted in 1849 because of the gold rush in California, a major &quot;pull&quot; for America. All of these pulls to America and pushes from other countries brought a lot of people to the U.S..</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how did all these people get here? It became much easier in 1869 when railroads that crossed the U.S. were invented. They were originally for transporting goods like silver and lumber, but they could carry people as well! Moving from one place to another become easier and faster! Now immigrants from Europe could take a train write to a boat.A trip that would've taken months was now much shorter with the advancement of trains and steamboats. An it sure did bring in a lot of people!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all of the &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot;, transportation advancments, and even the gold rush, its no wonder why so many people immigrated to Ameriaca. By 1860, 31,513,000 people were living in America, and 4,096,753 were not born in America! Also. there was 30,626 miles of railroad tracks in the U.S. alone! Theses numbers had greatly increased by the year of 1910, with 92,407,000 people in the U.S., 13, 3444,545 of which were born outside of America, and 240,293 miles of railroad tracks. That's a lot of increasing over 50 years!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its no wonder why all of these people came, with everything America had to offer. The 1800's really were what started making America what it is today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022121048	2364	1		20131022121022	2367	2		20131024101026	2405	2

They also moved to America because of the gold rush which &quot;pulled&quot; immigrants to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was easy to travel to America because since steam power was invented people could travel faster, and more efficiently. So that made it easier to get to a better place (A.K.A. The U.S.). So then that pulled even more immigrants to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, Freedom. Some people came, only for that. The freedom of religion, of speech, and waking up in the morning and not have to worry about some soldiers breaking into you're home and taking you away to a prison or something.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the rest moved here to get away from wars or to find a better place to raise their children. So that they can grow up in a safer environment where poverty isn't an issue and soldiers aren't pattroling the streets.

That was a great discovery that got a lot of attention and got millions and millions of people to America.The land now called&quot;A Better Life.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My fourth and last reason why I think people moved to America is because in the olden days it was very hard to travel to America.Now with steamships it's way easier.Without steamships there wouldn't be so much people in America as there is now.Steamships were very important in the old days.Without them life would be difficult for some people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As you see this are my reasons to why people came to America in the 1800s.I did four reasons out of a thousand of them.America fixed a lot of problems for thousands of people.That's why they call America &quot;A Better Life.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022121016	2367	2		20131022121028	2363	1		20131024111036	2405	2

There was a lot of slavery and the U.S.A. wanted to help those people who were slaves. The transportation was hard, but changed slowly to make it very easy to come to America. There were a lot of bad things and good things about transportation. Some people came to America just for the gold that was found here in the U.S.A. Most of the people who moved here for gold were the Chinese. Over the years many people have moved here in America and have stayed here to be free and live there lives fully in a very great habitat here in the U.S.A.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason on why people moved to America is that people who could build, farm, or invent were welcome at any time to come and live in America. The people who came to America came at just the right time because people invented technology. There were very large groups of immagrants who came to America starting with the Germans and the Irish. People in Ireland came to America because there was a lot of starvation there. For example: more than 1 million people in Ireland died by starvation. Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Jews came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The jews were not treated very nicely at there homelands. Now in America there are people from all around the world who came to the U.S.A. and have lived here to grow generations of there families and to let there childrens children live happily here in the U.S.A. and for years and years to come.</p>	2		20131022121004	2443	2		20131022121046	2367	2		20131024111037	2405	1

Here are some reasons why people moved to America in the 1800s.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, People came to America for happy reasons. For example, people moved to work. Working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America very quickly. This was a good thing because they were needed to work in new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Their work was very helpful to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, people came to America for sad reasons. For example, people living in Europe needed food, shelter, and jobs. Sadly, Europe did not have any of those things for them. It was a very sad situation. Therefore, they came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, people came to America for Industrial reasons. The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry improved lots! For example, transportation improved, and the first railroad crossed the United States in 1869. This made it a lot easier to move silver and lumber from the West to the East. A trip from one place to another made it much easier for immigrants to travel.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back on these facts, I realize that it was easy for some people to live, but not so easy for others. I have really enjoied reading this information about our country. Those were some reasons why people moved to America in the 1800s.</p>	2		20131022121020	2364	1		20131022121049	2367	2		20131024111027	2405	2

Many people came to America to find a place to work. Advances in technology brought people there too. One big attraction was the Gold Rush which sended thousands of people there. Most people outside of America knew very little about America, but what they did know was that it was a land of freedom, and that was what brought them there.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many immigrants from all around the world needed a job. During the 1800's there was new technology in America so there was plenty of jobs avaliable. Some immigrants like the Irish came to America to flee from starvation and crop failure and to look for a job. Other immigrants like the Europeans came to America because there were too many people and there were few jobs, food, and homes avalible. Many people came to America to search for oppurtunites of jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second half of the 1800's in America, technology grew. This made it easier to move resources and people to America. Inventions like the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many books and newspapers that made news and ideas available to more people than ever before. The invention of the telegraph and the telephone allowed people to become more aware of the world around them and more and more people moved to America. These inventions gave America more attraction.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848, gold was discovered on the banks of the American River in California by John Sutter. News of this quickly spread and people all over the world came to America. Over 70,000 people arrived in California in 1849 in search of gold and fortune. Exciting news of the gold rush spread throughout China and many dreamed of making a fortune there. Soon, more and more people came to America. In search of fortune, this has brought many people to America despite the hard journey.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America was known as the land of freedom throughout the world. Job oppurtunities brought many immigrants to America to make a living. Advances in technology helped spread the news of America and made it a lot easier for people to come. Attractions like the gold rush brought many more people to America. That is why many people traveled to America despite the harsh journey.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022121027	2364	2		20131022121036	2352	2

Over seventy thousand people looked for gold.Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast, the area could not produce enough rice to feed its people, especially when floods often destroyed crops.People felt hopeless and they listened closley to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean.The exiting news about &quot;Gold Mountin&quot;spread throughout China, many people wanted to join the gold rush.The 325 Chinese Miners who joined the gold rush were just beginning,the next year 450 more chinese arrived in California.</p>	1		20131022121046	2443	1		20131022121001	2372	1		20131022171007	2405	2

The 1800's was a very busy time peroid for most immigrants. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's next to the Germans were the Irish, one-fourth of the whole populatin of Ireland. People moved to America in the 1800's because of starvation, they needed jobs and homes, and pulls and pushes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Irish were so desperate for crops because their crops had failed in Ireland. More than 1 million people died thanks to the starvation. So they had to come somwhere, which was America.&nbsp; In Europe they started sending people too also to find work and avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom. Other stried to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>People started to come&nbsp; to America in the 1800's because they needed jobs and homes. The majority of the people that came to America came because of lose of food, jobs, and homes. These things are really important in like not to lose. If you lose these things of one of thesev things than you must comwe to America because it has all the stuff you need in order to survive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many peopkle cam e to America because of pulls and pushes. Pulls and pyushed are vary important in life too.&nbsp; Pulls are those features of life that attract you. For instance gold brought millions of peiople around the worls. These include jobs, welth, oppotunities, access to resoyurces, and precieved freedom. Pushed are those features that drive people away from their homes. Such as harshy enviornmenmt, wars and other comflicts, and poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, people started to move to America in the 1800's because of starvation,&nbsp; they needed jobs and homes, and of pulls, and pushes.

When the industry grew, a lot of immigrants came to America. Railroads were invented, so it made transportation a whole lot easier. A railroad actually crossed the whole United States! Lots of important products were moved across the United States, like lumber and silver. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1848, gold was discovered in California. The word got around that their was gold, so lots of people came to America. Lots of the Chinese came, but not just for the gold. Most of them came from Guangdong. Guangdong was in the middle of two wars, so many of the Chinese left from Guangdong for gold, and to escape the hard life of poverty. The Europeans fled from Europe because of the rough conditions and problems. The Jewish left due to violent attacks and criticism.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the Europeans were a big part in immigration.

Lots of technology was developed over time, which lead people from all over to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, immigration had a big impact on America.

Out of all of these countries the Germans were the largest immigrant group. People immigrated to America for many reasons like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources and freedom. People also immigrated to America because of hard times in their home land like a bad enviorment, wars or other conflicts and poverty. These are called the &quot;Pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls of immigration.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gold Rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gold Rush was another reason to immigrate to America, it made jobs and made some people rich. It all started in 1848 when John Sutter discovered gold along the American river in California. He tried to to keep it a secret but soon the word spread throughout the U.S. and to the rest of the world. By January of 1849, thousands of overland travelers and 60 ships were on the way to California. The gold rush had started. More than 70,000 people arrived in California in 1849. Among these people were 325 men from China. More kept on coming in search of a fortune in the California hills.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see in the 1800s lots of immigrants immigrated to the U.S. Between 1860 and 1910 the population of America increased by 60,894,000 people.

In Europe, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary are many places were immigrants come from. Some immigrants moved to the United States because of job opportunities, food, welth, better homes, and saftey. When these people immigrate to the United States there population increases. It can also decres because of the disesius they can carry and many people can die.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving to a new state is not easy because it may not be the same as there other state! They will be hard to move from one state to another because the new languge they have to lean, making new friends, the diffrent foods, diffrent laws and diffrent culcure. There are many more reaasons like finding a job, hard to leave friends and family, making new friends and the diffrent money!!Why diffrent money you ask? well if they lived in Europe, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Hungary dont have the money that we americans have. So there money would be worthless.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people may ''push immigrants away from your home.'' Why you ask?? Well it really isnt why its more like how immigrants can move to diffrent states beacuse of wars they had, or there crops dont grow wich means they didnt really have many food. They had made an easier way for immigrants to travel to diffrent sates. So they can carry there important belongings.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people may &quot;pull immigrants&quot;!! By all the things that attract people. Wich include jobs, money, freedom, better homes, and saftey!!That is why some people immigrate to the United States. It is better to move to the United States because alot of people from diffrent culcures immigrate here. Cuz' there is a little bit of everything.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally you can see how people immigrate to the United States of america.

I'll tell you what happened back then, and the meaning of the word immigration. The word immigration means when multiple people move from one country to another. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first reason is the harsh laws and ways these people lived back then. many people moved because of the opportunities that America gave to them like better jobs, more freedom, and a new start. This was true in Europe also.

During the 1800s, people in other countries who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ships. The single Largest group was the Germans. Next to them were the Irish. Before the Civil War in the 1860s one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to the US. The Irish were desperate because Ireland crops were failing and there was a food shortage and more than 1 million people died of starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the later 1800s, more people from Europe started immigrating to America. The population in Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All of those extra people needed food, jobs, and homes. But there just didn't seem to be enough in Europe. Many came to the United States to escape hunger and to hopefully find work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Others came for religious freedom. These included immigrants from Holland, and Jewish people from Germany, Poland, and Russia.(Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs.) Others came to escape wars that just made life too unstable and unpredictable. In total, 26 million immigrants came over to America in a 50 year period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sources: <b>A History of Us. </b>Hakim, Joy. <b>A History of Us.

It was hard back then to travel thru storms and bad weather because they had no cars to drive them where they needed to go. They had to travel by foot, wagons, and ride horses to get to America. When the immigrants got to the U.S. they searched for jobs. They hardly ahd any money to buy food or feed their child. Once the immigrants got a job they had enough money to buy a home and was able to afford food to feed themselves and their children. More and more immigrants were able to get a job until many jobs started asking about their papers. Many immigrants got fired or sent back to where they came from.

And that's why some of the people moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly people to places fast and easy people don't want to be late for there jobs. Even if they just want to look around they can just catch train that will take for a trip around California. Most of the people just used it for getting home and getting to there jobs. Some of the people used it just for a trip ended up moving there.And that is why some people moved to America. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally&nbsp; most of the people moved here because of the Gold Rush more than 70,000 people moved here because of the gold rush. People would call California &quot;Gam Saan&quot; or gold mountains. most of those 70,000 people were Chinese. Some of those people even came over sea more than 60 ship filled with thousands of people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will conclude my essay so as you can see most of the people had a good reason to come to America some people came because they needed more resources some came here for an easier transportation and most of the people came for the Gold Rush.</p>	1		20131024111021	2372	1		20131024111021	2367	1

They sailed across the sea to get there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;The largest single group was the Germans and next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest group. Before the American Civil War, 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children moved to America. They were moving there because their crops have died out. They were trying to get away from starvation in Ireland. About 1 million people died of starvation there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Later in the 1800s, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and other places started travling from other European countries that had not sent that many people to America before. The population doubled between 1750 and 1850. They all needed homes, jobs, and homes. They came to America to avoid hunger and find work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Others came for freedom. That included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Russia, Germany, and Poland. Others still came to escape wars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;The second half of the 1800 hundreds was a great increase in America. Many immigrants came on America's shores. Travelers could catch a train that took them right to a boat. The boat traveled faster now then before.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;More people came aware of the world around them and the ability to move along distances easily, they moved more than before. The moved because of &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls.&quot; Pushes were features of life that moved people away from their homes. Pulls are features of life that attract people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. Hundreds of people left the city and went off to the American River in San Francisco. By January of 1849, thousands of overland travelers and 60 ships were heading for California. The gold rush had begun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first immigrants from China were from Guangdong. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong had two wars between China and Britain. There were also rebellions against the government. The Chinese government raised taxes, but the farmers were unable to pay. They had to sell their land.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>People felt hopeless. They listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. They called it Gam Saan or &quot;Gold Moutain.&quot; They made their fortunes and returned to China.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The good news about that was many people China heard about it and wanted to join the gold rush. There was 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849. When it was just beginning. 450 more Chinese arrived the next year. Suddenly they came in greater numbers such as 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. In 1870 there were about 63,000 Chinese in the US. Although they could be found throughout the country most of them were in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;That's what happened in the 1800s. Many people from other countries came to America. They came for jobs, better lifes, and for the gold rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022111044	2367	2		20131022111010	2352	1		20131022171003	2405	2

They came to America in January 1849 in ships. There were 60 ships and thousands of travlers on the ships. All of those ships were headed toward California. They came because there was a war going on beween China and Britain. Most of China sailed over to California.The Chinese gave California a new name, Gold Mountain. Thats what they called California.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years America has changed for the immigrants. Most immigrants got jobs and some even invented new things for all to see. Some people didn't always have good times though because the Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions in Europe. Immigrants hoped with all their hearts to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States.</p>	2		20131022111035	2352	2		20131022111022	2443	2

You could create, build a farm, or make a small town! There was new technology as well along with factories. There were many jobs open for all, and enough to pass around. And that's exactly what the immigrants needed. Jobs, wealth, religious freedom, and food.</p> <p>Let's begin on the immigrant(s) that needed jobs and other things.</p> <p>Europeans: Europeans didn't have enough jobs in Europe! That meant there wasn't enough money for families to buy food, water, clothes, etc. And for survival, they moved to America to gain the jobs they needed.</p> <p>Next, is the immigrant(s) that needed wealth and other catagories.</p> <p>Chinese: Many Chinese people traveled to America to escape poverty and gain fortune. Mainly, because there was the Gold Rush running around in California (which they called Gam Saan). Might as well try, right? It was a certainly better option then starving to death or getting placed in prison. China was raising taxes impossible for the people to pay and their crops were growing too low to even come close to the pay, so they had no other choice than to go to to America.</p> <p>Last, but not least, the people who came for religious freedom.</p> <p>Russian Jews: Due to the war against Jews, and wars made by the famous and Terrible Hitler. The Jews ran away in order to survive, and came to America.</p>	1		20131022111048	2372	1		20131022111020	2364	1

People will just travel somewhere just to travel.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people travel because of money problems,or they need a job. The Irish, they also traveled to America because Ireland crops were failing on them. Its kinda like the Russian Jews they traveled away from there home town to somewhere else because of religious reasons. There was very many reasons people left there homes for new homes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1869 there was millions of people traveling from America because of the new railroad track that was just finished. The population was increasing every single day. Europe's population increased very much in between 1750 and 1850. More than 26 million traveled to the U.S.A. The population in places was getting out of hand.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man named John Sutter found gold in 1848. The word spread across the globe,by 1849 60 ships and thousand of travelers were coming to get some. Chinese people were becoming poor because there crops were not helping. These Chinese people called the mountain with gold on it &quot;Golden Mountain&quot;. The name stuck and to this day the mountains name is the same.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigration was big back then and it still is to this day. There are more immigrants today then there was 20 years ago. It is easier for immigrants to move today, because of a automobile and there is planes.

People died from starvation in Ireland. (more than 1 million) 1750 and 1850 the population of Europe doubled. There wasn't enough food, houses for all the new people so, Europeans moved to America to avoid hunger. Holland, Jews came to America from Germany, Poland, and Russia for religious freedom.

The chinese government also raised taxes. Lots of farmers lost their farms and came over to build the railroad. There were lots of family feuds because of the taxes tht the chineses government raised. China already had lots of birth rates. The chinese could not produce enough rice to feed al of the chinese.

It was very exciting to the immagrants because they could start a whole new life in a whole new place. They became very interested. The main reasons that they wanted to immagrate, is because of the California Gold Rush, Economy, and some people just heard that it was a great place to live.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, is because of the California Gold Rush. Many people heard that the most valuable resource was found in California. People came rushing to get it all before everyone else did. The population of California went from a big amount of people to a huge amount of people. Some people decided to move there and stay in case of more gold that was found. They were very quick to get to the gold and made alot of people immagrate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, is because of the economy. Many people needed better jobs for more money because they needed more to make a living. They all rushed and migrated into America. It was frustrating for everybody to find what they wanted from the different countries. They all rushed to find what they needed. Most of them were satisfied, but some weren't. They all looked very hard for what they wanted. It was very diffiult for everyone.</p>	1		20131022111006	2368	2		20131022111012	2364	1		20131022121025	2405	1

With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Immigrants did all that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. ( That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on property of a man named John Sutter. Although Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, the 1800s was a hard working time for all. In total, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.

More than <b><b>1 million</b></b> people died of starvation in Ireland.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the 1800s people started coming from other countries in Europe. These people were the Russians, Italians, Polands, Swiss, and from Hungary and Denmark. These people came for many various reasons. Those people needed food, homes, jobs, and clothing. And their country didn't have enough of it for everyone. Some people came for religious freedom. These people were Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California by a man named John Sutter. Many people soon found out about the secret of John Sutter, as he was keeping his discovery quiet. Many of the Chinese came to California in 1849 trying to strike gold because in Guandong they were in the middle of a war with China and Britain. Another reason why they came is because the Chinese government raised taxes and the Chinese couldn't pay their taxes and had to sell their land.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter where you come from or why. Everyone deserves to live a fair life. It doesn't matter if you're Chinese, Swiss, Italian, German, Jewish, Black, or any nationality or color or if you believe in something someone else does not. Everyone was created equally and should be treated equally. Who cares if someone doesn't believe on something you don't? Who cares if the color of someone's skin is different to yours?

Others immigrated from China in order to be involved in the California Gold Rush. There are several different reasons as to why people came to the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russian Jews came to America to have religious freedom. Jews left to escape prejudice and the harsh persecution and the violent attacks. They, along with many others from the European continent, were also sick of the harsh conditions that Europe had to offer. Everyone seemed to want to escape the hunger, unpredictable war outbursts, and of course having no control over yourself or desicions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Irish came to America to try and pry themselves out of the food shortage in their home country. They were willing to work wherever just to have a nice, hot meal in order to survive. Migrating to America seemed to be the only smart idea at the time for them, because everyone knew America was the free land that seemed to have everything in one's wildest dreams. Irish families were willing to do anything as long as it meant surviving, and if that meant going to America, then so be it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the immigrants of China got word the gold had been discovered along the American River in the great, sunny state of California in 1848. The Chinease decided the wanted to be in on the action, along with being free citizens, so, in 1849, various Chinease people jumped on one of 60 ships that were heading toward good ol' California. A little over 70,000 greatful adventurers arrived in California in 1849, also nicknamed the &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;. In the huge group of &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;, consisted of 325 men from China, but the following year, California would expect more from China to arrive. The Chinease wanted to find fortune, as well as the others, to provide for themselves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, this essay provides information to prove how intriguing America must have been back in 1800s to foreiners from all over. For those who escaped peacefully must have found what they were looking for. It still amazes me today that America stands with open arms to anyone who feels like they need an escape from where ever it is they may be.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022101025	2367	2		20131022111021	2363	2

Most immigrants came to America so they could find work. When they arrived in America they rushed out to find work so they could farm, build land, and invent things. Immigrants was able to do all of this. Germans were the largest single group of immigrants next to Irish immigrants. The Irish immigrants came because there crops weren't doing well.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, changes in America got eaiser for immigrants. When the change happend transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was complered in 1869. The new steamships had made a trip to America much faster. Then, the invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 made the news travel much faster.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, was the gold rush. Gold was discoverd in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in search of Gold. The Chinese govenment raised taxes when no one could find gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022101037	2372	1		20131022111009	2367	1

All of Irelands crops were failing to grow especially the potatos. Another reason was the Gold Rush in California. One more reason was because of the wars. They also wanted to come to America because we have freedom. They also wanted to make new lives for themselves.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, another reason was because of the increase for jobs. One more reason was all the wealth Americans had compared to their country. Another reason was that Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions of Europe. One more reason was that they could practice their beliefs. Russian Jews left to escape prejuduced persecution. Italians suffured from high birth rates and low farming losses do to lower prices.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the Chinese fleed from Guangdong because of conflicts and poverty. People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweedan, and Hungary left because extra people needed food, homes, and jobs. The Chinese also had family and village feuds and many rebellions against the government. Many Europeans came to find work and to avoid hunger.</p>	1		20131022101055	2368	1		20131022101043	2364	1		20131022121030	2405	1

In other countries, people saw America as the land of opportunity, a land of hope, a land of freedom. Many people in the different countries believed that they could live a better life in America. Immigrants left America for many reasons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First of all, Most of the immigrants left their countries because their country was restricting their people's religious freedom. No one wants to be told what to believe in. Another reason why they left might be because their country let their people die of starvation.\</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lastly, the California Gold Rush had caused many people to leave their countries so they can go to California and maybe get rich.

And I'm here to tell you about it. During the time countries were having lots of trouble except for America, so that caused people to migrate so immigrates from all around the globe came to America. Luckily for America that was when all kinds of new technology was here so that offered people jobs, like farming, working in factories, build, or even invent things. But it was worse for the Irish, because more than 1 million people died of starvation. And that caused one-forth which is 1.7 million Irish men,women, and children of the whole population of Ireland to come to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the later 1800's people started coming from other European countries because of their start of food storage. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. And others came for religious freedom these included people Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total, about 26 million immigrants came to the U.S. in over a 50 year old period. And this is what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. And they got it.&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022101005	2364	1		20131022101001	2367	1		20131024121014	2405	1

When the most immigrants came to America was in the 1800s, most of them came then because that is when a lot of the country's were at war or just not being fair to the people who lived there. Did you know that the Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants to to come to America in the 1800s. Then the Irish, before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-forth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.) They kept coming, during and after the war. the Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. this included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweeden, and Hungary.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores.Transportation got better and the first railroad that crossed the U.S was completed in 1869. This was a sign that pretty soon traveling would be easier and easier. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. This was true in Europe too. Travelers</p> <p>now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, however new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advantages in transportation made it possible&nbsp; for more people to travel more easily. People became more aware of the world around them and the ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever before. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. A man named John Sutter owned the property and he wanted to keep the gold discovery a secret. However the word got out and soon people from all over the world were looking for the gold. Most of the first wave was chinese and came from a place called Guangdong, an area on chinas south coast.</p>	2		20131022101057	2367	2		20131022101025	2352	1		20131022171018	2405	2

America's population grew by a ton of people, mostly Germans and people from Ireland. There were many reasons why people moved from their country, including health.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People refer to being forced away from their country as &quot;pushing.&quot; Many people migrated to America because they were pushed out of their own country. Russian Jews were pushed out of their country because people started doing organized, violent attacks on them. Other people, such as people from Ireland, were forced to move because many crops died. Moving to a place because you want to live there, is known as &quot;pulling.&quot; Many people also thought America would be a better place to live, so they moved there. Some other countries had harsh weather, causing people to move to America to get better weather. Other people hoped to find better jobs there, so they can earn more money to live.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese also came to America in 1848 to get some gold too. There were 325 men in all, and later, more people came.The gold was real popular at the time, and it became more popular as years passed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America was not just popular for the gold though. The weather was way nicer in America than it was in a lot of other countries. There was also more jobs available in America, causing it to also be wealthier. In America, people could believe what they wanted to believe, without feeling threatened in any way.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving to America didn't just help the immigrants start a new life, it also helped America itself. From 1860 to 1910, America's population grew by over 30,000,000 people. Also, the amount of miles of railroad tracks grew by almost 210,000 miles! Coal production also grew about 400,000,000 tons!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who live or migrated to America not only helped themselves, but they also helped America grow! Through the 1800's, people migrated more than ever in America. This helped America grow bigger, and it helped America become a stronger country.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022101017	2364	2		20131022101052	2363	2		20131024121057	2405	2

Some places immigrants came from were Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Three details for this is the history of immigrants, changes in America, and the gold rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The History of Immigrants is that at&nbsp; first only people that could build, invent, and farm came on ships to America. This was because America needed these types of workers for all the new technology they got. The immigrants came from many places around the world. A couple of the many places they came from are Germany and Ireland.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two reasons immigrants came to America were pushes and pulls. Pushes are the features of life that drive people from their homes. Some pushes were harsh environment, wars, conflicts, and poverty. there were also pulls. Pulls are the features in life that attract people. A few examples are jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason they came to America was because of a gold rush. A man named John Sutter lived on a property that had the gold rush. He tried to keep it a secret but that didn't happen. After a while the word got around San Francisco and hundreds of people moved to America. 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were on their way to California by January of 1849. That started the California gold rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those three reasons were why all those immigrants came to America in the 1800s. Even though they traveled very far they got what they wanted. That was freedom and gold!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022101028	2367	2		20131022101056	2352	2

Migration is in process!!!In the 1800's there was a lot of migration. Most of the time people migrated for many reasons like: shortage of food, harsh conditions, and more money.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'M SO HUNGRY! That is what a lot of people said in the 1800's. Back then, there wasn't that many resources, so one way to get food was to crop them, but a lot of the time it would fail. So, people were left with no food. Then, some people decided to migrate to America where the soil was better and their crops would grow better. This idea left people less hungry.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ouch! In Europe a lot of people migrated to America because of their harsh conditions. People were often treated very poorly. So, we can just say that in that country, you would be treated very &quot;roughly&quot;.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money, money, money!!! That is what everybody wanted! In 1848 the Gold Rush had started. People from China came all the way to California for gold. They all wanted to be rich so they could buy resources because back then, there really wasn't any resources that you could get for free.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all this migration the United States became very popular. After 50 years of migration the U.S. population went up over 90 million people!

During the 1800's lots people started traveling like the Europeins, and people who are from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Still other came from wars that made them move from were they were at before. Alltogether, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States more than a 50 year period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the people that lived in Ireland moved to the United States. They move because there was a hunger problem in Ireland, the crops didnnt grow any more there was no food so thats why Ireland had immigrents. Alot of people died from Ireland of the problems they had over there.There was 1 million that died of starvation.So thats why most of the Irish moved here.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	0		20131022101039	2364	0		20131022101057	2363	0

Also how they and their families moved to America to be able to do so. However not only Europeans migrated,; it was also Germans, Russians, and Irish. If you farmed you would move to have better soil and better weather. Not only farmers moved people such as Jews moved to get freedom of religion. While others came to escape all the pain, and suffering they went through in wars going on at their homes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of immigrants that came to America adds up to about 26 million; that was only in a 50 year time period. Many newcomers knew a very small amount of things about America. Actually the really only thing they knew about our wonderful country was that it was a land of freedom! That's exactly why they came here; to be free and have work!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>CHANGES IN AMERICA</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was only the first half of the 1800s. The second was a time of great change. Many more immigrants just showed up in boats and boats full of people! Also many things improved such as; the industries, and transportation. Their was an actual railroad built in 1869 this made it much easier to transport things. Just encase your wondering the things they would transport were things like: lumber (wood), and silver. They really needed this railroad because the silver was migrated from west to east.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that America wasn't the only country that got new railroads; because Europe got one too. When Europe got new railroads travelers could get on a train, which would take them to a boat, and the boat would take them to America. Now that you think about it railroads really just increased America's population and decreased Europe's. Railroads help America get more immigrants and helped form our beautiful country that we have today!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; News traveled fast in the 1800s, with the help of News papers and press. These press and steam power helped print books as well. Another thing that helped the fast as lightning speed of news traveling is the telegraph. The telegraph was invented in 1876.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most often reason the immigrants migrated is the <b>pushes and pulls</b>. The pushes are those reasons that make someone move out of their home, town, state, or country. The pulls on the other hand are the reasons that make people want to visit that place. Otherwise known as an attraction.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>GOLD RUSH!!

That something is known as <b>Gold.</b> Gold was discovered some where along the American River in California on a property owned by a man named John Sutter. This man was stingy! He wanted to keep the gold for himself. Somehow the word got out all over San Fransisco. People wanted gold. So then started the <b>Gold Rush</b>. The Gold Rush is where people start a gold mine and dig for gold. More than 70,000 people came to dig, hoping to find just an ounce of gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know that football team the 49ers? Well the gold rush was in 1849 so they called the people digging the 49ers. Since the gold rush was in San Fransisco they are the Sn Fransisco 49ers.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they heard the Chinese rushed to America and to the gold rush. The Chinese were, like many others, wishing on stars to find gold. The government raised taxes, because of all the immigrants coming. So in ways the gold rush was good and bad.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most felt hopeless and closely listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. They called California Gam Saan, also known as Gold Mountain. To some it seemed kike a land of riches. They wished to go, make their fortunes, and return home, to China. 63,000 joined the gold rush in all those years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was my report on Immigration, Immigrates, The Gold Rush, an the pushes and pulls.

In Europe King George did not allow different religions there so they were forced to move. Finally the immigrants population was 26 million people!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many changes in America back then one of them was transportation.

One of those reasons were because they weren't accepted where they live. Also there might not have been enough food for everyone in the country. Or maybe they were kicked out of there country for there beliefs. Or maybe they left because they wanted too. So let me tell you more about this time period.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, they might have moved because they were not excepted. like the Jews were not excepted in Russia. The people were prejudice and they were persecution. There was also violent attacked towards the Jews. They also had to leave a lot behind when they decided to come America. They migrated for there family's and there self's , because where they were was not a home it was a place where people like them were killed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next , there was also not enough food for everyone in Europe. The Irish came to America because there crops had not grown. 1.7 million Irish people had came to America too try new crops. They were desperate people in this time because they had no food in Ireland. More than 1 million people had died during this time. The population went down, down ,and down.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, they might have been kicked out or maybe they wanted to leave. In 1848 63.000 Chinese people were in America. They all came because the gold rush; more and more came as people found more gold. The people from Holland and the Jews left so they could have freedom in there beliefs. Most of the people were mistreated if they didn't believe in something someone else did. They came here to America so they could be able too believe with out being hurt or killed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now you see the people back then had a reason why they went or stayed some where. The Jews and the Holland people left so they wouldn't be mistreated. The Chinese came so they could get rush. The Irish came because they needed food. So now you see why people did what they did.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022101030	2363	1		20131022101030	2443	2		20131022161015	2405	2

In fact one-fourth of Ireland was in the U.S. In the later 1800's other countries came like Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,and Sweden.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others came for religious freedom. For instance the Jew's were often mistreated because of their beliefs in their home country. Still others came to escape wars that made lives unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last 50 years 26 million immigrants lived in the U.S. People still came to the U.S and they still do, but even though immigrants know little about the U.S they know it is home of the free.</p>	2		20131022101021	2363	2		20131022101048	2367	1		20131024121013	2405	2

Then later on they made more things that they could think of to help use like a book to read ,newspaper, telegraph and a telephone.People became more aware of he world around them and the ability to move long distances easily,they moved More than ever be for .The push are those features of life the drive people from their homes and other places.These include jobs ,wealth opportunities access to resource.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next the gold was discover in the 1848 along the American river in California.They tried to keep the discovery a secret word of the finding soon reached of San Francisco and thunderers of people left the city to set off for the American river.In&nbsp; January 1849 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California and the California gold rush had begun. The chines government raised taxes farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their lands.The exciting news about gold mountain spread though out china many people wanted to join the gold rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly know you know what had happened in the united states and the gold rush.</p>	1		20131022101046	2367	1		20131022101016	2368	1

Many years ago people migrated a lot over to America, &quot;Why?&quot; you may ask, well I&nbsp; will tell you right now.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 200 years ago people from different places all around the world came here in America! America is known to be a free country because you can have any religous beliefs, we are a pretty rich country, we have enough food for everybody, and we have jobs. Most of the people that migrated to America came for those reasons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s 1.7 million people came from Ireland because their crops failed, there was a food shortage, and a lot of people died in Ireland from starvation. later on people started coming from many more countries like Russoa, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and more. Many Europeans came to America to find work and get food.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people came to America because of their religous beliefs. Many other countries do not have freedom like we do. Their president or king will make them believe how they believe. Some people will get thrown in jail or even get killed for believing in a different religion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people came for money! The gold rush was very famous in America and many people came from China to get gold. The man who discovered it didn't want anybody to know about it, but that didn't last for long. So many people heard about this that over one thousand people came from China to get gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can tell a huge population came to America. In 1860 the U.S population was 31,513,000 in 1910 the population grew to be 92,407,000, there are even more people now because most of those people had kids and then they had kids!

The Irish decided it was enough and they were going to move to America to start a better life and have better opportunities to do things. One-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.) Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. (Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.) In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in United Statesover a 50 year period. Think about that...26 million !

The reason for this is that Immigrants are not always from the same place I am or you are. They can either be from a different continent, country, state, and city/town. The information being written below is from the story &quot;<b><u>Moving to America</u></b>&quot; by Joy Hakim. Immigraton began around the 1800's. Most of the immigrants were all heading to the same place Ameirca!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America was in the neccesity of people working for new technology. Immigrants were arriving at just the right time to help America progress. The immigrants were capable of doing all that was asked including working in factories, to farm and build on land, and to help invent new mechanism. The llargest group of immigrants was the Germans, then the Irish. Some immigrants moved to America from their home country because they came for religious freedom. But the most important thing was to help, create, and earn jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This source of information in the next paragraph is from <b>&quot;<u>Changes in America</u></b>: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants.&quot; As he years would come and go in the 1800's many changes were happening. Immigrants continued arriving to America and indrust grew more and more. The ability to transport items such as news and material became more convenient....</p>	1		20131022091044	2372	1		20131022091000	2367	1		20131024121024	2405	1

This was a good change to most at first there were more resorces easyer to work and they had found gold. But then more people started plling in and resourecs droped and money was hard to handle most people moved and abandound all of that to go to other places.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s working people who could build farm or invent came to America. They travled to America because it had lots of land and resouces they came out with new tequnoligy and there were much for them to do. The people came from europe and germany and many others, and those people came for jobs and money and power.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on americans shores. This ment a trip from one place to another with resouses or goods became easyer and soter. but this was also true in Europe. Travelers now could caatch a train that would take them right to a boat. But there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information travled , the came out with productus like the newspaper these were pulls they all started to attract people. The pushes on the other hand were diving people from there homes like the harsh enviorment and poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gold rush was probly one of the harsher times when they first discoverd gold in 1848 along the american river in california. When John Sutter discoverd gold most locle people became forty-niners (men from china that dug for gold). Then almost every one was on the hunt for gold this was called the gold rush during the gold rush most people were push out and taxes were raised people became angry.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s the hole world was going through alot of changes from new jobs and tequinoligy to going crazy over a new thing called gold. These changes have made the world what it is today even thou it was so long ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	0		20131022091038	2352	0		20131022101013	2372	1		20131022171027	2405	0

For one, people came for more money and better jobs. The United States had advanced in technology, so people could invent new things. They could also build or farm. Ship after ship came to America, all carrying people that wanted a better life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason for so many people coming to America was that people were starving in their home countries. One example is Ireland. When their crops (especially potatoes) failed, over 1 million of Ireland's people died of starvation. As a result, 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People also moved to America for religious freedom. People in Holland, Poland, Russia, and some Jews from Germany, were all being treated unfairly for their religion. Other people came to escape wars that made life uneasy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other times people were pushed out of their country because of harsh environment, war, and poverty. Some were pulled by things that attracted them. These pulls included jobs, wealth (gold, etc.), new opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Population increased wildly throughout America. In 1860, the population was 31,513,000; but in 1910, the population was 92,407,000. Over a time period of 70 years, the population increased by 30,894,000 people! And that is why people moved to America in the 1800s.</p>	2		20131022091035	2443	2		20131022101022	2363	2

Immigrants helped America with tecnology in the 1800's. Germans were the largest group of immigrants, next to the Irish who were the second largest group of immigrants. Before the civil war 1.7 million (1/4 of the population) Irish people came to America. The Irish came during and after the war, they were desperate because in Ireland crops failed, there was a food shortage (about 1 million died).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the 18800's people were coming from other European countries that hadent sent many people to America before. Such as Russia Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweeden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All the extra people needed food, homes, and jobs. Immigrants werent helping Erope. So many Europeans came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some immigrants came to America for religious freedom. Especially people from Holland, and Jews from Germany, and Poland, Russia. Other immigrants came to escape wars. In total about 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. over 50 years.

They wanted to be rich because most of them hardly had any money. So finding gold was going to make them rich. They didn't know what the money was worth.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some of them came to north America because they didn't have jobs. Also they didn't have freedom so they came over here. on the other hand some came for land because they heard of it. some wanted to get away from their family. on the other hand some had to come for there freedom. there were many jobs here in north America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they came they had new laws they had to learn.

People have&nbsp; migrated to America to have a better life and jobs. In addition, people in the 1800s came to America on ships. Imigrants knew they would have a better life in America, beacause of the technology&nbsp; there was lots of open jobs like factories, farming, etc. Most of the immigrants during the 1800s came from <b>Europe</b>.</p> <p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, there where many changes in America , the US had more than enough population in 1869. There was now telephones invented in 1876 which only made news travel faster. People became more aware of daily news. Europeans now wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. More, ahead Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portguese, and Armenians also moved for a new/better life. Also, Chinese immagrants wanted a better life, because they found out that there was a land of gold and 325 men became whats called the gold rush, because they where also going through harsh times like, poverty and taxes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Conclude, during the 1800s people migrated to America for a better way of living.

When you get to the new area you're in, you feel shy and scared because you do not know what to expect in the neighborhood. You go to a whole different school with new people! Now imagine that on a larger school from moving from a country to a country! Many people in the 1800s moved to America, a place of place of freedom for all people. The people over there speak a new language and culture you do not even understand! This action of moving from a country to another country is called immigration. Many people around the world immigrate for many reasons including to escape poverty, find new riches, religious freedom, or to find a job to support family. There are many pros and cons for immigration in the 1800s ,but which side is right about immigration?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people think that immigration benefits people all around the world, but why? In the 1800, many countries had harsh conditions that made living there hard so they traveled to America for freedom. A rapid increase of birth rate made life even harder for the family will need more food to survive. However, in America there were many jobs available, so there are more jobs for immigrants so they can feed their family and themselves. Not only that, but people like the Jews have religious freedom so they can pick any religion they want. Also, people can get rich from treasures that await in America like the gold rush so people will not be in poverty. In America, immigrants hope to make a new life for themselves and families in the United States. Even though there are good reasons for immigrating, there are always the drawbacks of it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022091053	2363	2		20131022091032	2367	2		20131024121017	2405	1

In America, people are free to roam where ever they want. There</p> <p>aren't any kings or queens that governed the United States until later. Many Germans and Irish people came to America due to food shortage in their homeland. For example, Ireland crops had failed, and there aren't lots of food. During the Gold Rush, at American River, California Chinese people from Guangdong because they were escaping from conflicts and poverty.

In 1852, there are twenty thousand and twenty-six Chinese people in the United States. Germans and Irish decided to go to America as well because there was food shortage in Ireland.

This is why the population of citizens in America have been increasing over the past two centuries. the reasons will be backed up with information.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans came to America for the food. The Germans get better treatment in America. The jobs are more available. Nearly, one million people in Germany died from starvation! That is a very good reason to come to America. The Germans came to America for better treatment.</p> <p>&nbsp; The immigrants from China came to California because of the gold rush this gave the Chinese jobs that gave money to make a living and raise a family. The Chinese came to America because there were more opportunities and jobs in America than China.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Europeans came to America because the trains and steam running cars. This made the Europeans come to America because the transportation to work rather then going on a boat this has increased the miles of train tracks. The Europeans came to America for transportation.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase of the population in America was due to immagration. This is why the population of the US is beacuse this country is advanced and fair.

They were either attracted to a place or pushed away from it because they didn't like it. Why a big amount of people migrated into America is because some wanted to escape harsh conditions, or find something you desire, or because food shortages.</p> <p>&nbsp;One reason why people wanted to migrate into America because to escape the ways they were before. Russian immigrants left their homeland because prejudice and persecution. In Southern Italy, people suffered from farming losses or birth rates. If the first born male leaves, then their brothers and sisters will have no land that is passed on to them.</p> <p>Another reason why people came to America is to find fortune. In California 1848, a guy named John Sutter found gold. He wanted to keep the discovery a secret, but soon people from all over the world came to California, only for gold. China was in the middle of poverty and conflict. There was a war between China and Britain, and there were many rebellions. Farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their land, while the population was increasing. They couldn't grow enough food for the community.. but soon, the rumor of gold spread to China, and they wanted to become part of the gold rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;Finally, some people came to America because they had food shortages. In Ireland, they were in desperate needs because their crops had failed. More than 1 million people died. Also, in the 1800s, the population for Europe was doubled. A lot of people needed a place to live, employment, and food. So Europeans left Europe and went to the United States to find a job and to avoid starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;So why people left their land and migrated into America is because to escape hard conditions, find something you desire, or because food shortages. If people did not migrate into the United States, the population would of been lower, and other countries can struggle finding food, or a job, or a home to give to their people.</p>	2		20131022091017	2352	2		20131022091017	2367	2		20131024121023	2405	3

The reason why people move from their home could be called pushes or pulls. Pushes are when people want to leave because of critical conditions. Pulls are the things that attract people enough to move.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many pushes that caused people to move to America. For example,&nbsp; the Irish moved to America because crops have failed in Ireland, especially the potato crop, causing more than one million people to die of stravation. Another example is that Russian Jews left Europe to escape from the prejudice and persection from pogroms, organized violent attacks. The third and last example of a push is that suthern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses. Also, people became landless because of the tradition of leaving land to the oldest male sibling. Besides pushes, there are also many pulls that caused people to come to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many pulls that caused people to come to America. One of the reasons is that there were many job oportunities in America due to new technology. These jobs included needing people to work in new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Another reason is access to resources and the freedom to express religious beliefs. The third and last reason is the Califonia gold rush. People migrated from China because of dreams of making fortunes and returning proudly to China.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more than a few reasons why people came to America in the 1800s. There were many pushes that included harsh enviroments, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. There were also many pulls that included jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and preceived freedoms. These are just some of the reasons why people moved to America.</p>	2		20131022091053	2367	2		20131022091044	2443	2

Some arrived simply just because they wanted to be here or were looking for a new house. Some were in war, and&nbsp;wanted to get it out of&nbsp;trouble. Then their was a time when chineese people from Guangdong an area of China's coast came to America. They&nbsp;came for the gold rush,since&nbsp;&nbsp;they heard that American people found gold by the American river a majority account of people started to arrive.

They needed to work in factories to farm and build on their land,and to invent things.Germans and many other types of race as well went to America for the same thing.Jews where often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.Others had still came for their religious freedom.And fought wars that made life be unstable and underpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the paragraphs Changes in America:The&quot;Pushes&quot; and &quot;Pulls&quot; for Migrants. The second half of the 1800's was a time of great change in America. There industry grew and many immigrants had arrived on America's shores.There transportation had improved,the first railroad trip that crossed the United States was finished in 1869.It became easier to move from one place to another.And people had gone to places easier.People had became aware of the world that was around them and since they had the ability to move along distance easily,they did so and moved along then ever before.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last paragraph of Gold Rush! Chinese moving to California is about how gold was discovered.American River in California was the place where they had found gold on the property of of a man named John Sutter.He tried to keep the discovery a secret but the rumor had spread out to San Francisco,and from there hundreds of people knew and left the city to go to the American river.And the news spread to the rest of the United States,and other parts of the world.Many people had traveled to California such as thousands of people and that is how the gold rush began.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last paragraph which is the chart helps you in understanding the story a bit better and it helps you with knowing the time of dates things had happened and when they had happened.Such as the number of people in the U.S. from the year 1860 to the year 1910.And the number of people who had lived in cities, and the number of people who were born outside the United States.Also with other things like coal production in tons,miles of railroad tracks,and the number of daily newspaper all from the same year of 1860 to the year 1910. So it helps you to get to know the story a lot better and to the time period of things.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion I hoped you enjoyed reading my article on Cultural Heritage Day to recognize those who were migrated in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022091035	2367	2		20131022091036	2352	1		20131022171041	2405	1

Some, came to start a new life, while others came to escape poverty and wars from back home. Others, came to America to find gold and get rich. They all came for two similiar reason though. Freedom and a chance to work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; begin with, lots of people came to start a new life. People in Ireland came to America because there crops were crumbling and millions of people were dying of starvation. They thought that America was a chance to escape all that, and to find a chance to work. In addition to the people of&nbsp; Ireland, people from Holand and Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came to seek religious freedom. Not only did people come to go to America for religious freedom and a chance of new lfe, they came for the riches of California. According to &quot;Gold Rush! Chinsese Move to California&quot; , many Chinese people came to look for gold after getting news of a man called John Sutter, finding gold along the American River in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, to the enlargement of immigration movement, many others came thanks to the improvement of things such as the industry and transportaion. This improvement created the first railroad in the United States in 1869. Not only did it help transportation, it helped trade! The new railroad made it easier to move things like lumber and silver from the West to the East! But, the possitive effects of the enlargement of immigration don't stop there, it helped people come to America easier by catching a train and then boarding a boat. Normally, this process would take months.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did the immigration of others help transportation, it helped spread news fatsre. For example, the steam power and redesigning of the printing press helped make new travel faster. This helped make news and ideas available for everyone. Furthermore, this then led on the the invention of the telegraphy in 1844 and the telephone in 1876.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the enlargement of immigrants in America helped improve this country alot.

Pushes are the harsh conditions of their homeland that push people away while pulls are the better features in life that America pulls people to.The main reasons of why immigrants immagrate are: for the better future they might have in America or the harsh features of life</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One reason why people moved to America was because of the features that drive people away from their homes. In 1860, the Irish were desperate because in Ireland, crops had failed like the potato crop. Since there was a food shortage, more than 1 million people died of starvation. In the later 1800s, people started coming from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary to find work and avoid hunger. Many new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions such as prejudice and persecution from violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered high birth rates, and farming losses from lower prices. Their tradition of leaving land to the first-born male left younger siblings landless. When the Gold Rush was going on, most Chinese of Guangdong took this as a chance to flee conflicts and poverty</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p>	1		20131022091048	2367	1		20131022091052	2364	1		20131022101011	2405	1

However, not everyone traveled the same journey. Different people took different paths that were told in stories such as Moving to America, The &quot;Pushes&quot; and &quot;Pulls&quot; for Immigrants and Gold Rush! Chinese Move to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Moving to America people who could construct, farm, or invent traveling to America in ship. With the rising technology in America there were a lot of jobs to do such as working in the new factories, to do farmwork, to build, and to invent new creations. Germans were the largest immigration group,&nbsp; after the Germans the Irish were the largest group. The Irish were in poverty because the crops in Ireland had failed, especially the potatoes. This caused a shortafe of food killing millions of people from starvation. During the late 1800s people came from many European countries, including Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The people all needed food, shelter, and a job to support their family. Many others came for religious freedom. Which consisted of Holland, and the Jewish. Over a period of 50 years about 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the other half of the 1800s industry rose and more immigrants arrived. The first railroad that crossed the United States had finished constructing granting an easierway to mover resources for West to East. People were also allowed on the trains making trips shorter and also easier. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it more sufficient to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. New European immigrants wanted freedom from harsh conditions in Europe. More immigrants started to arrive in the United States again, once again increasing the population.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During 1848 along the American River in California, a man&nbsp; named John Sutter discovered a secret that spreaded to San Francisco attracting many people. The news start to spread all over the United States. The &quot;Forty Niners&quot; were a band of men from China. Most of them came from Guangdong the men were fleeing from conflicts and poverty. They nicknamed California Gam Saan meaning Gold Mountain. These men were part of what we now know of the Gold Rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Along the immigrations of many people they encountered hardships and obstacles. Different people took different paths which were told in stories like Moving to America, The &quot;Pushes&quot; and &quot;Pulls&quot; for Immigrants, and Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California. All these people moved from their former homes because of different reasons such as poverty, or war. In the end all these people reached their destination to find safe haven in the United States.</p>	1		20131022091005	2367	2		20131022091036	2368	1		20131022101048	2405	1

But in America Noel's their career could make them earn a better profit, then what they used to get in their other countries.

The railroad was invented and was used as transportation. It was a great way to migrate for immigrants. It was easier to move resources like silver and lumber to other places. A railroad was a great invention to migrate.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People started to become aware of the ability to move in the world around them. Reasons that immigrants moved is because of things that are pushes and pulls. Pushes are features of life that makes them leave because of harsh environment and other bad things they suffer. A pull are things that would attract people to other places. This is when there is good wealth, access to resources, and there may be freedom.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; America really grew and changed between 1860 and 1910.

So, in the following paragraphs, I will explain how and why these immagrants came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the early 1800s, Germans had one of the largest population at the time. After the Germans was the Ireland. But soon, the population of Ireland decreased and America's population increased. The reason that this happened was because food was dying in Ireland, especially the potato&nbsp;crop. So, while&nbsp;&nbsp;that happened, America's population increased and soon caused industries to hire more people and farms had more foods to crop. Eventually, Europe began to do the same thing and more people moved to Europe. Between 1750 and 1850, Europe's population doubled and Europe just flerished. Around the 1860s, that all changed. About 26 million of the Europians moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That year, the first railroad tracks were finished which meant more people could get across America and gold and silver could be taken to the East from the West. After this phenemonon, steam boats were invented more people could travel faster. Sadly, Europe built their railroads and had steamboats to. Soon, in the mid 1800s, a rapid change in transportation happen. Steam powered machines began and a new,&nbsp;redesigned printing press made newspapers possible for more people. Also, inexpensive books were beginning to be made. Eventually, more people around the world became more aware and had the ability of moving long distances. Once people in Europe heard this, people wanted to leave Europe's harsh treatment and go to America. Immagrants soon came to America to make a new life and have families in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once it became the year of 1848, a man named John Sutter. He was walking along the river and saw something in the water. He picked it up and saw that it was gold. He tried to keep it a secret but the word got out. Soon, it was all over the United States. Then, It was heard around the world. Eventually, it was heard in China. Once they heard about it, they all wanted to come to what they called &quot;the Gold Mountain&quot;. The reason they&nbsp;wanted to go to &quot;the Gold Mountain&quot; was because many farmers and Chinese people had to pay taxes. So, if people went to America and came back with gold, they'd&nbsp;be able to pay their taxes and be proud of it. Once this happened, not many farmers were still there and many starved from the little food that farmers have grown. Another problem was that a flood could cause all the crops to flood and die causing starvation for the people. While this crisis was happening in China, about 63,000 Chinese went to America to mine for gold. At the end of the gold rush, about 77 percent of the Chinese were in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So many of the world's immagrants came to America. Some for money, some for food, even some people came over here to raise&nbsp;a family and live a peaceful life.

I told you about it's historical advances and how it grew. A lot of people came to America for freedom in which not a lot of people had back then. In the 1800s there was war and lots of fighting. For the people who lived in those places it was inhabitable. They also came to America because everybody could come and new inventions were being made. They also came for the good climate too. Lastly ,this is why America was the first place people could go to and not worry about major problems. This is why America was chosen.</p>	1		20131022081021	2367	0		20131022081046	2363	1		20131024121027	2405	1

Many of the new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered form high birth rates and farming losses due to low prices.

That's right immigrants did all of that. But the Germans made up the largest group. Next to them stood the Irish. The Irish were desperate because their crops had died and hunger spread through out Ireland. In the later 1800s the pop. of&nbsp; Europe doubled. All those extra people neede jobs and other resources. So they came to America to avoid starvation and get a job. Others came for religiuos freedom.

In earlier times it would have taken months for a sinle trip. Steam power and redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and news papers. News got aroun faster thanks to the invention of the telegraph and the telephone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gold was discovered by a man named John Sutter. He tried to keep it a seceret but word reached San Fransisco. By January 1894 thousands of travelers came to California to look for gold. Among these &quot;49ers&quot; were 325 chinese. MOst of the chinese were from Guangdong, an area on China's south coast. Its pop. was growing very quickly and floods often destroyed the crops. People felt hopeless and they listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. They dreamed of going there, becoming rich, and returning to China proudly.

Not everyone who came to America had the same purpose of why they came. They all had different reasons. What you are about to read lists a few of the different reasons why people came to America. Whether it be freedom, wealth, or just because they like it here.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. After that were the Irish. They were the largest of all. Before the Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the population of Ireland immigrated to the US. That's about 1.7 million Irish women, men, and children. They came during and after the war. The Irish people left because the crop in Ireland failed, especially the potato. There was food shortage, and more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America earlier. A few countries included Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and Russia. Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Europe had doubled. This meant that all those extra people needed food, jobs, and homes-but there just didn't seem to be enough for everyone. Many Europeans came to America to find work and avoid starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others came for religious freedom. Some people came from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their homeland. Others came to escape wars that made life miserable and unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, about 26 million immigrants came to America in a 50 year time period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Part 2&quot; of the 1800s was a time of a great boost in technology for America. Industries grew, and many immigrants came for work. The first railroad that crossed the US was completed in 1869, making it easier to transport cargo and people to other places. Steamships were also invented, making a trip to America faster than before. The telephone and telegraph both helped news travel faster between people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People became more aware of the world they lived in because of these inventions. The redesign of the printing press allowed cheaper books and newspapers to be printed, allowing even more news and ideas to reach the common people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s, there were two types of immigrants, &quot;<b>Pushes</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Pulls</b>&quot;. <b>Pushes</b> are the features of life that drive people away from their home. These include harsh environment, wars, and other conflicts and poverty. <b>Pulls</b> are the features in life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the people in Europe left because of harsh conditions. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution in the form of pogroms-organized attacks. Southern Italians struggled with high birth rates and farming due to lower prices. Hungarians, Poles, Greeks, Armenians, and Portuguese also moved to America in search of a happier and safer lifestyle for them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, excitement exploded all around the world. By January of 1849, almost 60 ships and thousands of land travelers were headed for San Francisco. This event is known as the Gold Rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were about 70,000 hopeful miners who arrived in 1849. These people are called the Forty-Niners. Among them were about 325 Chinese immigrants. More and more Chinese came flooding to California year after year. Like everyone else, they were hoping to get lucky and find gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the first wave of Chinese immigrants came from Guangdong, China. These Chinese people came not only for fortune, but to escape poverty and conflicts. Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britain. Many rebellions and infinite village and family fights left Chinese people with a dream that things will get better. They saw the Gold Rush as an opportunity to escape all the drama going on where they lived. In fact, the Chinese people even gave California a special name-Gam Saan, or Gold Mountain. They wanted to go there, find riches, and come home with pride.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 325 Chinese who joined the Gold Rush in 1849 was only the start. In 1850, 450 more Chinese showed up in California. The numbers increased until there were more than 63,000 Chinese living in America. That's a pretty big number, which is why they even founded a Chinese community. Today, it is known as China-Town. The Chinese played a very important role in building the first transcontinental railroad. Although Chinese people can be found throughout America, about 77% of them lived in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021161027	2363	2		20131021161054	2443	2

Many of the European immigrants wanted to leave the harsh conditions of Europe such as wars. Some Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger.

Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to taxes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large groups of Chinese also came to America during the gold rush. When John Sulter found gold in California many people from all over the world came to California. People came from all over the world and among these men were Chinese. They came to flee poverty and conflicts. Many farmers were unable to pay the government taxes. The population was growing quickly, but there was no food to feed them.

The second half of the 1800s was greatest time of change though. More immigrants traveled to America, industries grew, and transportation improved. In 1869 it became easier to move resources from the West to East because the first railroad that crossed America was built. Though there were some pushes and pulls during this time. For example, a push would be the Europeans that wanted to escape the harsh conditions and the Russian Jews that left because of prejudice and persecution. One of the pulls would be inexpensive books and newspapers and the telegraph that was invented in 1844. One of the greatest things discovered by a man named John Sutter in 1848 was gold. More than 70,000 people arrived in California in hopes for gold and 325 of these people were the Chinese. In China, the government raised taxes and the California gold rush seemed to be the only help the Chinese could get. In the end, it was a success for the Chinese. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States with jobs and played an important part in building the first transcontinental railroad!

You would have had to been really brave to come over to america because you where leaving everything behind; your money, your house, your job, you language. Everything was new, sometimes you might have had to change your religon. When you got to America you might not know what the lanuage is, that is something you would have to learn in order to live hear.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could come herer and have a really good life, or your could fail and not be able to go back home to your own country. Sadly many people ended up like this due to them not having that much money coming over here. The people like that were stuck in America until they could afford a ship home. Sadly most people never could get home.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you where to have come here with a good ammount of money you would be able to afford a house and maybe get a good job. If you where to have made it in this country then you where very lucky. Many people in other countries did not have that much money to bring to America, so they became homeless.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These is what it was like back in the old days. It was mostly due to money that people came to America because they were so poor inn there home country. Some made it, others didn't. This is what life was like in the 1800's.</p>	1		20131021161003	2363	1		20131021161058	2367	2		20131022091007	2405	1

These people were looking for many things, including jobs, gold, freedom, food, or homes. With all the new technology, and growing industry, there was plenty for them to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the later 1800's, people from Russia, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and Poland came looking for homes, food, and work, many came to avoid hunger. People from Holland, Poland, Russia, and Jews from Germany came for religious freedom, and still many others came to escape the wars that were making their lives unstable and unpredictable. Before the American Civil War in the 1860's, one-fourth of the entire population of Ireland came to America. In Ireland the crops had failed, especially the potato crop, and more than one million people died of starvation in Ireland. The Irish kept coming to America, during and after the war.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Russian Jews came to America to escape prejudice and persecution, southern IItalians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. These immigrants were desperate for help in the U.S.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Guangdong, an area on China's south coast was involved in two wars between China and Britain. This led to many rebellions against the government and endless village and family fights. The Chinese government raised taxes, farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. The area could not produce enough rice to feed it's people, so when the Chinese heard about the gold rush in California, they were desperate, and 325 Chinese came to take part in 1849.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These iimmigrants from all over the world came to America with many things in common, a need for freedom, food, work, and to make their lives better.</p> <p>They helped build America, and were able to work in factories, to farm, and had religious freedoms, and became inventors. I can conclude that the 1800's was a great time for these immigrants to arrive in America and have their needs fulfilled.</p>	2		20131023091050	2367	2		20131023091019	2352	2		20131024151006	2405	3

John Sutter was the first to find gold on the American River. Many people went to California to look for gold. They would rush there before all of it was gone. Millions of people were present in California looking for gold. There were many farmers who could not pay for taxes so they had to sell their farms. This would've been the perfect time for them to earn some money.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Come on! We must hurry to California. There is gold waiting for us,&quot; Captain Benjamin Arlington told his crew. They were a poor family that was looking for a way to earn money. They have been poor their whole life and this was the perfect time for them. They were a British family and had little money to pay for taxes.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family rushed to the California gold rush and claimed a spot to dig. Captain Ben searched for gold morning and night. The 2 children and a mother tried to find a place to work.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Momma, why won't any body accept you for a job? I am tired and hungry,&quot; the youngest of the children asked. heir mother did not answer. She just continued walking and asking people if she can have a job. All of the answers were no. They just remembered about their father. They wanted to tell their mother, but they were scared that she wasn't going to answer. Finally, when she was about done asking for jobs, she remembered about Ben.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Ohhhh Noooo! We forgot about your father. We have to go and find him. What if he is hurt? Who is going to help him. We have to hurry back to him,&quot;their mother said. They rushed back as quick as they could. They found him and asked how much gold he had found.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I found 32 ounces. This might be enough to buy whatever we want to. Do you guys want me to keep looking or should we go home?&quot; Captain Ben told his family.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We should go home now. I am hungry and tired. I think you can't find anymore anyway,&quot; the oldest child said. The family went to the dock and sailed back to Britain. They could now afford to pay taxes.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most families like the Arlington family traveled to America just to get money. The family got back to Britain and never had trouble paying anything anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023091034	2367	2		20131023091012	2363	1		20131024141036	2405	2		20131025161005	2363		M

A lot of new inventions were made like the telagraph and the telaphone. A lot of Europeon immigrants moved to America because they wanted to start a new life in America. Chiniese moved to America because a lot of people were poor there and they wanted to find gold in california and then return to china with gold and stuff. First there were 325 Chinies in the gold rush, then it turned 63,000 in 3 years the population growed between 1860 and 1910 in America because of the gold ruch and stuff like that.</p>	0		20131023091040	2372	1		20131023091038	2363	0		20131024141038	2405	0

People immigrated to America because of the industry, the Gold Rush, and religious freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800's the industry grew rapidly and with that the population did, too. In the industry growth the transportation improved. People had invented better ways to transport people and other objects. It was also easier to move resources that people needed for everyday life. Also, along with the indusry growth came more jobs and opportunities. This drove many more people to the U.S. because they were desperately in need for money for their family. The Gold Rush was a very big event that drove people to the U.S. , too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People also moved to America because a large event, the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush was a time when people had moved to America in search for gold. This attraction definately made the population grow. Even though this event attracted many people, it did not benefit. People hadn't found much gold if at all.This wasn't the only reason why though, people also moved to America for their religious freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People in other countires had to believe what their country believed. Some people had not agreed with their country's beliefs so, they either protested or moved to America. Here in America we have religious freedom. In other words, we could believe whatever we chose.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who moved to America definately benefited because they got a better industry, their own religous freedom, and they might even have possibly gotten some gold from the California Gold Rush.</p>	2		20131023091038	2368	2		20131023091015	2372	1		20131024141034	2405	2

Some people immigrated because of &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; reasons. &quot;Push&quot; reasons are when somebody is forced, or driven from their home. &quot;Pull&quot; reasons are when there are new, better opportunities in other countries that could better your life. Wether for either of these reasons, immigration in the 1800's was very interesting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many people from Ireland (in fact, over 1.7 million, or one fourth of the population) came to America for &quot;push&quot; reasons. These people from Ireland had to come in order to have food. Back in their home country, Ireland, these people were going through starvation. Over 1 million people had already died from starvation there. A new group of immigrants came from many different European countries. These people had to find jobs, food, and homes. There didn't seem to be enough of these things back in their home countries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>People from many different continents all over the world had come to America because of &quot;pull&quot; reasons. In the 1800's, people had immigrated to America in hope of becoming rich during California's Gold Rush. By 1849, more than 70,000 &quot;Forty-Niners&quot; had immigrated to America. You'd probably be surprised to find out that most of these people were from China. Although many people were unlucky, and didn't find gold, these people were important in molding America's history.</p>	2		20131023091022	2367	2		20131023091033	2352	2

Especially with all the technology, there was lots to do. They came to find jobs and be free so they can raise there families. The gold rush was another big cause of a &quot;pull&quot;. When gold was first fond in 1848, and the word had already spread quicker than lightning, the next year, 1849, 60 ships and thousands of traverlers were heading towards California. Then the gold rush had started. According to Source #2, more than 70,000 hoeful adventures arrived in California 1849. There was 325 Chinese men in that astonishingly large mob of &quot;forty-niners&quot;. The &quot;pulls&quot; were usally the good reasons why people came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>However, &quot;pushes&quot; are the <b><b>bad</b></b> reasons why people move to America. In the 1800's the Germans were the largest single group of immigrants. Aside of the germans, were the Irish. In the 1860's, before the American Civil War, 1/4 of the population in Ireland came to America because in Ireland the crops never grew and they were on a food shortage. Therefore, more than 1,000,000(one milliom) starved to their deaths in Ireland. Europian immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Euorope. In Source #2, it says that Russians Jews left to escape prejudice and persicutions, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks. Italians from the south, suffered from high birth rates and farming losses.The chinese, from the gold rush went to California for fortune because of conflicts and poverty. The area couldn't make enough rice for all of the people, especially when floods killed the crops.These &quot;pushes&quot; caused lots of lives, but it also helped even more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These &quot;pulls&quot; and &quot;pushes&quot; were no fun for these immigrants lives that rush and flee from country to country. The &quot;pulls&quot; helped a lot in there lives. On the other hand the &quot;pushes&quot; destroyed and hurt lives because of conflicts, poverty, violence, etc. But with hard work, jobs, food, and chances in life, you can live a pretty well offed life in the free country, America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023091023	2367	2		20131024151028	2443	2

Can you amagine, 1.7 million Irish people. They came no matter what. Even during the civil war. They were desperate because the Irelands crop was no good. They were low on food. Over One million people die of starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the 1800s, people from the European countries started coming that have not been sent to America before like Russians, Italians, Polish, Danish, Swedish, and Hungarians. Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Europe doubled.

Many of them had been pushed out of there homelands and came to America seeking freedom. Some seeking religious freedom, others seeking the freedom of speech and legal assembly. No matter why they came they all got a chance in the new world.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The pre-Civil War time period had the most immigrants from Ireland about 1/4 of the population of Ireland came to America. Thats 1.7 million people. They mostly brought out of Ireland because of failed crops. This is a example of a &quot;push&quot;. A push is what drives the immigrants out of there home country. The &quot;pull&quot; is why a immigrant goes to a certain place. A example of this is the famous &quot;California Gold Rush&quot;. Many Chinese people came to America seeking a fortune they can proudly take back to China. By 1870 there was a estimated 63,000 Chinese people through out America. 77% of which were in California. Immigrants have many industrial values. Such as the coal production increasing to 417,111,000. Miles in railroad tracks increased to 240,293.Population grew to 92,407,000. All of these between 1860 and 1910.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude my informational text i would like to sum all i said up. Many people in this world have qualities they need to put to use. So they came some where they could. It helped the population and industrial growth in America. In 50 years over 26 million immigrants had come to America. With out of which we probably wouldn't have all the cool stuff we have today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023091037	2367	2		20131023091054	2368	2

The Irish were the second largest group of immigrants. Before the the American Civil War in the 1860s, 25% of the entire of population of Ireland came to America. Altogether, that is 1.7 million men, women, and children from Ireland came to America. The Irish were desperate because the crops failed, especially the potatoes. That led to a food shortage so that caused more than 1 million people to die of starvation in Ireland.</p> <p>&nbsp; Later, other countries sent people to America that didn't usually send people there. These countries include: Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Europe's population doubled in between 1750 and 1850. The people needed food, homes, and work. It didn't seem like there was enough food, homes, or jobs in Europe so many of them moved to America to avoid starvation and to find a job.</p> <p>&nbsp; Others came to America seeking religious freedom. Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Others came to escape wars. Altogether, around 26 million immigrants came to America in only 50 years! Once the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed, transporting goods and people became faster and easier.</p> <p>&nbsp; Steam power and the printing press allowed people to print inexpensive books and newspapers which allowed people to spread news faster. People sometimes came to America to escape pogroms-or organized violent attacks. Others wanted to make a new life for themselves and their families.</p> <p>&nbsp; A man named John Sutter found gold in California and tried to keep it a secret but word spread to San Fransisco so hundreds of people headed for California in hopes of finding gold. More than 70,000 people came to California in 1849. 325 of these &quot;Forty-Niners&quot; were from China. More Chinese men came the next year,and the next. The Chinese hoped to find a fortune in the California hills because they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.</p> <p>By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States that all played a part in building the first transcontinental railroad.</p> <p>By 1860, there were 31,513,000 people in the U.S. America has a rich history and it is a free country. That is why America has a rich and diverse culture.</p>	2		20131023091053	2352	2		20131023091036	2367	2

First,many people moved beacuse of the wars. Second, many people also moved because of the gold rush. Third, there are many other reasons too.The wars made people wnat to move.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wars had an impact on many people. First, wars always make some people get involved in them. Many people got caught up in it. The Chinese migrants from Guangdong was caught up in the two wars between China and Britain. If they move to the United States of American, they wouldn't have to be involved unless they wanted to. Second, many people suffer from the wars. Wars make governments tell people to ration their food. Some people have so little to eat that they die from starvation. If they moved to the United States, the people can decide wether they want to ration their food or not. Even if wars had an impact on some peoples' lives, the gold rush turned some peoples' lives around.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gold rush was a blessing&nbsp; to some people. First, the gold rush let some people who were poor, get rich. The poor really enjoyed that. If they struck gold, they could win the love of their life or treat their sister's illness. The rich also enjoyed getting more rich too. Second, this was a blessing to the Guangdong. Since their population was growing, they needed money, food, and a place to stay. The gold rush got around, and before long, many people were striking gold! The Guangdong were also free of the wars.</p>	2		20131023081006	2367	2		20131023081029	2443	1		20131024151012	2405	2

You hear about the crop fail in Ireland, The American Civil War, and the religious hate that is going on all over the world.

These peole have come to America to experience the freedom that we have everyday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There were many &quot;Pushes&quot; and &quot;Pulls&quot; that made forigen people want to come to America. A &quot;Push&quot; is something that drives people from their homes. A &quot;Pull&quot; us something that attracted people to come to America. Some of the &quot;Pulls&quot; that were happening all over the world were harsh enviornments, wars, conflict, and poverty. Some of the &quot;Pulls&quot; that were happening in America were jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.</p>	2		20131023081019	2367	2		20131023081051	2352	2

They were doubling in numbers quick. As they ran out of food, clothes jobs they really just came into poverty like most Americas are today but back then it was a lot harder .When they came upon a add in the newspaper they started to fly over . It was Mexico jump-en jelly beans it was crazy .As more people came over from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark , Sweden and even Hungary.A total of twenty six million people had came over to America. Most of them knew little about our country. They only knew that it was free and had money to feed there family's give shelter and a chance to work .</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second half of the 1800s it was a time of change most of the immigrants arrived on the seashore but the first railroad was completed in 1869 and it made it a lot easier . Even as the process got easier times didn't get as easier as the United States though they had to life triple everything coal,money,cut trees and even make more newspaper.With a few&nbsp; more inventions life became a little easier the telegraph and telephone in 1844 and 1876 made news travel faster.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When gold was discovered in 1848 beside the America river in California news spread all over the world as hundreds of people started to come over the Gold Rush had begun .More than 70,000 eager adventurers came to the America river to seek for there future. Many Chinese migrants came from Guangzhou. They were trying to get away from conflicts and poverty . Very slowly millions of Chinese had moved to country to get away from there bad life to seek gold in a fortune and a happy life and it was completed in the late 1800s To a ending total there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States. They could be found all over the place but 77% of them were in California living a happy and free life like they are suppose too.</p>	1		20131023081015	2368	1		20131023081056	2443	1

Also,&nbsp;People from European Countries such as,&nbsp;Russia,&nbsp;Poland, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary.&nbsp;1/4 of all the&nbsp;people from Ireland also came because of food shortage, and the Irish people made up the second largest group of immigrants with about 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In source #2, the second half of the 1800s was a time of great changes in America.&nbsp;Industry grew, immigrants arrived on America's shores, and transportation improved greatly. Now, since the transportation improved, such as the first railroad that crossed the U.S was completed, people can now move resources such as lumber, food, and even minerals like silver. Once the people learned much about the world, they came to the United States, seeking a newer world with freedom and great jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In source #3, once gold was discovered on John Sutter's property, thousands of people came to the State of California, of 70,000 forty-niners, 323 men were from china. Most of the first group of Chinese immigrants came from the town of Guangdong, an area on China's southern coast. The people from Guangdong were fleeing from conflicts, poverty, two seperate wars, government rebellions, taxes that were raised, seemingly endless family feuds. The rest of China was being very short on foods becaues floods often destroy their crops (such as rice or wheat) for their rapidly growing population.Each year, there were many more Chinese immigrants, first was 325 in 1849, next was 450 more in the year of 1850, then in great numbers such as 2,716 in 1851 and then 20,126 in 1852. The chinese played an important role in Califronia and the U.S.A because they helped build the first transcontinantal railroad(all across the U.S), and about 77% of all chinese in the United States are in the state of California.</p>	1		20131023081036	2367	2		20131023081005	2352	1		20131024151028	2405	1

Many came hoping to have a better life. The reasons for coming to America is different for all the immigrants.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans were the largest group of immigrants to immigrate to America. The second largest group of immigrants were the Irish. The Irish came to America because they were suffering a famine back in Ireland. The Irish were desperate for a better life, so the Irish immigrated to America. Soon after, people started coming from other countries. The southern Italians experienced high birth rates and farming decreases due to lower prices. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary were some of the countries. The people from those countries came because they all needed food, homes, and jobs. Some people from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia came to America seeking religious freedom. Jews were constantly mistreated for their religious beliefs. Overall, many came to America so they could escape their dreadful life back at home.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sudden increase in America's population was ginormous! 26 million immigrants immigrated to America over a 50 year period. During the second half of the 1800s, even more immigrants arrived!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for the immigrants coming to America this time was because of the American industry growth. People in America could now import and export products faster. The printing press was able to print books and newspapers which meant news could travel faster. By 1844, the telegraph was invented, and by 1876, the telephone was invented.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; An example of immigrants immigrating because of what they &quot;wanted&quot; is the California gold rush. News of the California gold rush spread throughout the United States. Over 70,000 people came to California seeking for gold in 1849. Many Chinese came the very next year. They were looking for fortune through gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Chinese came from Guangdong, China. They wanted to escape conflicts, and poverty. The people of Guangdong were rebelling against the government. The Chinese government raised taxes, and farmers who couldn't pay the taxes had no choice but to sell their land. For this reason, Guangdong couldn't produce enough food to feed its citizens.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As time passed, more and more Chinese came during the California gold rush. The Chinese played an important part in building the first transcontinental railroad.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, America wouldn't be as diverse and technological if immigrants hadn't arrived. The immigrants were essential in order to accomplish many things in America.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161050	2363	2		20131022161044	2364	2

These immigrants believed that if they moved to America their lives would get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800's immigrants from ireland were coming to America to find better places to grow potatoes. In ireland the potato crop was having a bad harvest every year due to harsh conditions. Due to harsh conditions they immigrated to America.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid 1800's people were migrating from many countries in Europe. Some countries were Hungary,Russia,etc. The reason for their immigration was due to the population in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1800's the chinese imm igrated to america because of harsh crop growing conditions and they had heard the word about gold. Many came for gold others came due to harsh environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why many countries immigrated to America in the 1800's.</p>	1		20131022161011	2363	1		20131022161015	2352	1

Later in the 1800s more people started coming to America from other European contries.

They came to America because they were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things, which immigrants all did. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the entire Irish population came to America, which was 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. They kept coming, during and after the war. They were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage, and more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In total, after immigrants from Ireland, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Germany, and more came to America, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. The first railroad that crossed the U.S. was finished in 1869. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. In the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely information traveled. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. Although he tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of it soon reached San Francisco. Later, the exciting news about Gold Mountain spread throughout China. Many people wanted to join the gold rush.</p>	2		20131022161041	2363	2		20131022161002	2367	2

Those people helped create the world as it is today. Many people came for many different reasons. For example, many Chinese people came from 1849 to 1870 for the gold rush. Many people also came for new opportunities. Many people came for jobs, wealth, access to resources and perceived freedoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people think of immigration as &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull.&quot; To push means to get kicked out of their homes or country. To pull is to get lured into another country. For example, many European immigrants got pulled into America because they wanted to escape their harsh living conditions. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution in forms of pogroms (organized violent attacks). Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower crop prices. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the U.S.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Stutter. After a while, word broke out around the world and many people came to California. In 1849, China 325 men came to America. After losing many homes and farms, people from China thought they could become rich if they find gold in America. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then in 1851, 2,716 people came for the gold rush. More and more people came year after year.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you see that many people immigrate, from all around the world. Those people helped make the world as it is today.</p>	2		20131022161035	2367	2		20131022161034	2363	2

Some immigrants came for religious reasons too. For example, in source #1 people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, because Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. The population in Europe doubled in 100 years, 1750-1850. Also, in 50 years America gained 26 million immigrants. Most of them went to America because of freedom and they had a chance to work. In the late 1800s, in Europe traveling became much easier. You could catch a train and it would take them right to a boat. From Europe to America, earlier people thought that it took months to travel that far, but with new steam ships it doesn't feel like months and it is much faster! Also, in the 1800s, they made a new printing press so it was much cheaper to print books and newspapers. After the steam boat and the new printing press, that got people flowing with ideas, for instance, the telegraph was invented in 1844 and the telephone was invented in 1876. People became used to the world now with all the new equipment. the reason people immigrated was because of the pushes and pulls. A push is where people get driven out of their own home, maybe because of war and a bad neighborhood. A pull means something that attracts people, such as jobs, money, opportunities, access to resources, and freedom.</p>	2		20131022161044	2367	2		20131022161054	2368	2		20131024141045	2405	2

Well, I have. Alot of things happened the 200 years acually. Alot of people went their own way and some just stayed in their country and dealt with what they got. Some countries had things happen to them that are really bad and didnt know how to fix it so they just did what they had to do, do their own thing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Germans were the largest single group of immagrants in the 1800s; the Irish were the second largest group.One-forth of the whole population of Ireland came to America because the crops in Ireland failed (Thats 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children). More than 1 million people in Ireland had died because of starvation.They were desperate for food and hoping that someone could help.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many people came to Europe and doubled its population from 1750 - 1850. 26 million immagrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Thats a lot of people that came to the United States. The number of people went up by 60,894,000 people from 1860 - 1910. Think of how many people that is, and thats just a little part of the earth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A lot of people that stayed in the country that their from needed help, jobs, food and a lot more things. They didnt know what to do. They were really scared and eventually, they died because of starvation and probably sickness. Alot of people just wanted freedom, a chance to work, and help, a lot of help.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second half of the 1800s were good though. The transportation was improved and the railroad that crossed the United States was completed. Alot of good things happened in the second half of the 1800. Now, lets keep our fingers crossed that everything will be good.</p>	2		20131022151057	2367	2		20131022161019	2372	1		20131024151051	2405	2

Irish people, German people, Chinease people, and lots more have moved all over the world, most have migrated to the United States of America. There are still people migrating today from city to city, state to state, or even country to country. I think this has enhanced peoples cultures and ideas.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germans started moving to the United States in the 1800's. Irland started sending people before the civil war which was in 1860's and even through the war. Later Europe sent people to America including Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. European people came for jobs, homes, food, ect..</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People started making advancements in America such as the steamboat, trains, telephone, the printing press, ect.. Know people could trade faster on water with boats and trade faster on land with trains. This created more jobs for people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More jobs are made by finding gold! People went out to find it. Chinease even came out to find it around 324 men. Thease men were called the &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;. They were mostly from Guangdong a area of the southern coast of China.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclushion inthe 1800's people migrated and most were to the United States, like Germany and Irland.

I will tell you why those sre the most inportant reasons in the following paragraphs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First of all, freedom is very inportant because if we didn't have freedom then our live wouldn't be the same. We wouldn't get the job, clothes, friends, or choses that we want. It would be like we are traped in a cage beacuase we wouldn't be able to do the thing we want. Other people will tell you who to hang out with, what to wear, and what you will be doing for the rest of your life. Thats why the peopole moved to the United States so they could have they freedom. They get to choose who to hang out with, what to wear, and what you are going to do for thr rest of your life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Secondly, the food that they had were they used to live died. All their food failed to grow and they starved to death they almost died. If&nbsp; they wouldn't have found the United States the they would have died and never survived. Luckly the United States has good soil so that they are able to grow crops for their familys.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally last of all, a place to live if they don't have a place to live then they would be very cool in tha winter. They would have nothing to keep them from getting wet like a roof over their head. Also they would have to have nothing to cook their food on like a stove or an oven. If they have a house it would blouck out the storms, strong wind, and rain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion thats why many people have moved to theUnited States. Even today many people are still moving to the United States. IT has realy helped alot of people because of how much is provided. IT saved a lot of lives too and has helped people who don't have alot of money.</p>	1		20131022151011	2352	1		20131022151002	2367	2		20131024161015	2405	1

Another reason they came is because there were wars going on during the time also. A lot of people were dying of hunger too. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Other reasons are because there was a big gold rush during 1849. So many Europeans for the gold rush to try to find a good fortune of gold. Most of the people that came were Chinese people because they were trying to find the big fortune in California's hills. A lot of people found gold and they where not in poverty any more and they found jobs in the U.S.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	1		20131022151017	2443	2		20131022151011	2352	1		20131024151054	2405	1

The tranportation imporved. The travelers could catch a train that will take them to a boat. The invention a telegraph and telephone mad news travel faster. The immagrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and there families in the Uited States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chinese goverment raise the taxes. The farmer who coulnd't pay the taxes had to sell there land. The chinese called california gam saaan, or the gold mountain. The chines wanted to join the gold rush. The immagrent wanted FREEDOME and wanted to work.That is my story about the immagrents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	0		20131022151017	2352	0		20131022151036	2443	0		20131024141019	2405	1

But yet some people stayed, these are called the pulls the pulls include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was another push for people to come to the U.S. Gold was discoverd in 1848 in San Fransisco. More than 70,000 people came to California. These people were called the forty niners.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1860 to 1910 a lot had changed of America like the population. In 1860 there were 31,513,000 people in America then in 1910 the population was overloaded to 92,407,000. during this time America was getting a lot of people from outside the u.s. In 1806 the people born outside the u.s. was 4,096,753 but in 1910 the population of imagrints shot up to 13,344,545. With that many people in the u.s. production shot up to...

If some of them had not, some of us could be living in Europe!</p> <p>&nbsp; Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. The second largest group of immigrants is the Irish. About 25% (1.7 million Irish men,women, and children) of the Irish moved to America before the american civil war in the 1860s, due to the Great Potato Famine which took 1 million Irish lives. They kept coming, during and after the war. The irish were very desperate because the most important crop, Potatos had failed, along with most of the other crops.</p> <p>&nbsp; In the later 1800s, people started coming from the other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. These include Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. This is because between 1750 and 1850 the populations of Europe nearly doubled. There just didn't seem to be enough food, homes, and jobs in Europe for them. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S over a 50 year period. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work.</p> <p>Many new European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms-organized violent attacks, Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. The traditions of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless. Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and thier families in the U.S.</p> <p>As you can see, lots of people Immigrated to the U.S., but the main reason is because high rates in child birth, crop failiure, and most of all, to get freedom. If these people didn't face the challenges of Immigrating to the U.S. some of us wouldn't even be in the U.S., we would be Europeans!</p>	2		20131022151046	2443	2		20131022151047	2367	2

Also people from Ireland was the largest immigrant group. More than 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children came to america because of attacks and crops that had failed like potatoes. Irish famillies came over to America just to find food for their families because of the crops. There were 26 million immigrants that came to</p> <p>America total! The newcomers knew very little things about America except that America was a land of freedom. The immigrants that came to America wanted freedom and a job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s, there was a change in America. There were more transportation like the steamships and the train that first crossed the United States. The train helped a lot of people travel faster. One of the big reasons why immigrants migrate is the pushes and pulls. One reason why some immigrants move to America is the wealth, the jobs, and the freedom. Russian Jews left because of the organized attacks.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 1848, gold was discovered along the American River in California. A man named John Sutter discovered gold on his property but then the word spread and immigrants from China came to California. On 1849, 60 ships were loaded with travelers. More than 70,000 adventurers arrived in California in the search of gold. There were 325 Chinese men came to America for the gold rush. The Chinese came over to America from Guangdong to flee from wars. One war was between China and Britain. The Chinese government raised the the taxes and farmers weren't able to pay the tax. Guangdongs population went up so high that they couldn't produce enough rice to feed its people. Floods often destroy crops in Guangdong. 450 more Chinese arrived in California. More and more Chinese people arrived every year. By then on 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Chinese and other adventurers are in search of gold and the Irish people are starting their new lives with jobs. That is why immigrants migrate to America because of then land and the it is the land of the free.</p>	1		20131022151056	2364	1		20131022151036	2367	2		20131024161037	2405	1

My mom had trouble going to America because her family didn't have nothing so they had to walk through deserts and a lot of obstacles throughout the whole time. My mom missed the rest of her family that is in Mexico at the time but she knew that they might come back for a while or so to welcome us. It was hard when she had to bring nothing like her clothes,toys,or food because there was only five of them going to America. When she finally got ther she was glad not like ordinary people saying this place is horrible or it took to long.</p> <p>Migrating or imagrating is tough because sometimes when you grew up in the same house for a long time and when you move the feeling goes away like when you have to move to a different state or country like you go to New York or moving to China just because of better needs or for are a better job. It is hard to stay strong when you are sad that you know your moving to a different house or place because you are going to feel different in your gut saying &quot;this does not feel right&quot; or &quot;I want to go home&quot;. When imagrates want to come in a certain area there will be differnt people and places so if you do not want to be home sick just get your favorite object and bring it and enjoy it while you can. In the beginging of knowing you are moving you are possibley going to be happy or depressed about&nbsp; moving to a new place you have never been before. If the place you are moving to is far then you might be really sad because it feels weird in your gut and you are going to say to your parents why did we have to move.</p> <p>It is hard moving to a different state like Oregon, Texas,California, or Florida. When you move to a state you will be surprised or sad to see new buildings or friends that you've missed for a long time. It can be hard when you are moving to a different state because there is your family back in your old house, like you have your favorite relatives like your uncles,aunts,cousins, and grandparents. You might have to go to a plane or drive all the way to your new house but when you do that it will cost money for a plane or a moving truck for your items that you own. When you move to a state always remember your family and the things that you have as a gift of life.</p> <p>If you move to a different country it is going to be a lot of work to do when your there. When you move to a different country&nbsp; you are going to have to learn a new language and a new religous. When you move to a country always remember to do your best of what you don't know if you go to a different school and learn something new. If you go to a country like China,India,or Russia then you are going to have to learn new things like rituals and celibrations. If you go to a different country then you are going to have to see new friends and a new home.</p> <p>I always wonder how many people are in a state and in a country when I move somewhere or anywhere I go. When I move I always say how many people moved this time of year or decades. When I am in a new house I always want to think about people going somewhere in there life like in a different place. I want to count how many people went or came to the same location or time of this year. Finally when I move I feel bad for the people missing there things and stuff for themselfes also for there family. &nbsp;</p>	1		20131022151009	2367	2		20131022161029	2363	1		20131024161024	2405	1

More jobs were made from builders to inventors. Almost everyone had a job. America's religious freedom was another reason for immagration. Easy transportation made in easy to get to America.

When people came to America they didn't feel like moving so they settled in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Russian left to escape prejudoce and persecution.

Another main idea about this story is that the second half of the 1800's was a great time of change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores and Transportation was improving. They also had created a new railroad in which made things easier so that they could travel more faster and get to their destination quicker.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then, there is a thing called The &quot;Pushes&quot; and &quot;Pulls&quot; for Immigrants. Pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes. These include a harsh enviroment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty. Many of these push elements were made worse by a rapid increase in the number of people in Europe. On the other hand, Pulls are those features of life that attract people. These include jobs, wealth, oppurtunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Conclusion, what i think the point of this passage was is that the Immigrants had to move from their homes and go to different counries and states because of their wealth and oppurtunities they had in life.</p>	1		20131022151001	2367	1		20131022151002	2368	1		20131024141055	2405	1

Then the chinese herd about the gold so they went to San Francisco.By 1870, there were 63,000 chinese in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after 200 years of immigration many people came to America.Many people were happy when they moved to America.After the Gold Rush 77% of the chines came to America.

Immigrants were needed to work in the new factories, farm,&nbsp; build on land, and to invent things.Only immigrants did all of that.When the immigrants left to America they got there right on time because there was alot of technology that they can use.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.The Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole immigrant group in Ireland came to America.They kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in ireland crops had failed to grow, especially the potato crop, then there was a food shortage. More than one million people died of starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. That included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All of the extra immigrants that stayed needed food, homes, and good jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Europeans only came for religious freedom.

Between 1750 and 1850, the population of Europe doubled. People needed food, jobs, and homes to survive, so they came to America. Other people though, came for religious freedom. Most of them included, Holland, and Jews that came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The rest came to escape from warzones that made them suffer.

Sometimes, there are good things pulled out of it. Sometimes, you are forced. Being puled in a country is better than being pushed. Pulled is when you are making good things out of traveling where you are. Pushed, on the other hand, is when you are living in war, poverty, or even harsh environment, and you are being forced, or you have no choice but to live in America. Moving to America in 1800's was clearly hard. America's population rapidly increased when alot of countries decided to come over 60 years before the Civil War. Several reasons cover this experiment, such as freedom. Therefore, the main reason is freedom and a chance to work. However, moving to America was trouble. They came from ship after ship after ship. But immigrants would do sacrafices for living in a great place, America. There are two different choices in going to America, being pushed, or being pulled.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One choice in going to America is being pushed. For example, the Irish came to America because they had food shortage, and they were starving. Failure was in crops, such as potato crop. Many came to America to search for a job and to find more food to aviod starvation. Another example is that they came for religious freedom. These countries include Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews, for example were mistreated in Germany for their own beliefs. Other countries came for freedom and to escape wars. To sum it all up, pushes are people being driven out of their country. Main reasons are a harsh life they live in, wars, problems, and alot of other negative possibilities.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last choice in going to America is being pulled. One example is in the 1800's. Gold in California, America was discovered, which led to the gold rush. One country that really wanted to strike for gold was China. Their government raised taxes, which meant less money for farmers, and any other person. In that time, there was also war, which meant less homes, but the government still went on. By that time, a lot of people rebelled against the government. The climate there was also bad, which did not help the farmers any better. So that is when a lot of people started hearing about the gold rush in California. They started moving to America because of the gold to make fortunes, and return to China, arrogantly with all the gold. That was an example of being pulled, because they got something good out of it. Another example is because of the advance in technology. Being pulled means that you want to go to some country to get somthing good out of it, and it is your choice to go or not.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two different choices in immigrating to a different country are called &quot;pushed&quot; and &quot;pulled&quot;. These two mean two whole different things, but that is what basically causes increase of population in America in the 1800's. Being pushed means you are forced to leave to another country, and being pulled means choosing to leave to a certain country to get something good out of it. One example of being pushed is because of a harsh environment. An example of being pulled is to get gold from a certain country.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022151038	2367	2		20131022151059	2363	2

One of the big reasons people stared coming to America was the gold rush. It was discovered in&nbsp;1848 by John Sutter. He wanted to keep it a secret but it didn't stay one.

These reasons included things in America that attracted people, or &quot;pulls&quot;, and things in home countries that people wanted to get away from, or &quot;pushes&quot;. People came from all around the world including China, Germany, Poland, and Russia. More than 25 million people came to America during the 1800s.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s, people came from all around the world to come to America. People came from countries like Italy, Poland, Russia, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and Germany. People came for different reasons. Some people, such as the Jews, came to America because they were being mistreated in their home countries for their beliefs, and they wanted religious freedom. Others came to America to find work, because work may have been hard to find in their home countries. Some people, such as the Europeans, came to America to avoid hunger. However, in the mid-1800s, most people came to California to become rich.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1849, gold was found on the property of John Sutter. Once people discovered that there was gold in California, they flooded to California in search for gold. People came from all around the world, but many people came from China. In 1849, only 325 Chinese men were searching for gold in California, but by 1870 there were 63,000 Chinese in the Golden State. Most of the people that came from China came to find gold, but a lot of people came to get away from the Chinese government. At that time, the government had raised taxes and many people were rebelling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1860 to 1910, the population of the U.S. almost tripled. There were many more employees and much more product production. Coal production became 21x more efficient. Railroad tracks became 8x longer. There is no doubt that population grew during the 1800s.</p>	2		20131022151025	2443	2		20131022151045	2363	2

Some wanted to escape to religious freedom (Russian Jews)-others dreamed of not living in starvation any longer (Irish). Here are some very descriptive examples on why different immigrants chose to come to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Irish were known to come to America to escape food shortages because of their crops-which had failed. They wanted to escape starvation and regain what they once had. There were many food shortages and that caused over 1 million people to die out of starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Others, wanted to escape to religious freedom and have the right to believe in what they did. Jews who came from Germany, Holland, Russia, and Poland were mistreated because of they believed in. In America, they had the right to believe in what they believed in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Some Chinese arrived from an area in China called, Guangdong. People who moved from there, moved because of the two wars taken place there at the time. They were &quot;pulled&quot; by the fact they could become rich if they got their hands on the beautiful gold found in California's rivers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you can see, people from many different places were especially determined to get out of their home country for many different reasons.

Immigrant came to America because they wanted to start a new life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many immigrant come to America for a better life, or their country is in war. Back in the day immigrant came to America because they were pushed out of their country.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the 1800's many immigrants came to the U.S because of two reasons they were pushed out or kicked out.Or&nbsp;they came to invent new &nbsp;inventions with all the high tech gear.Most came to live here to start all over again to forget about what happened in the past.A lot happens in the 1800's but let's flash forward toward the year 1869.lots of people move to the U.S because they were pushed here or attracted here.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1869 the first railroad was able to take you from the east to the west. It&nbsp;was fast enough to take you where you were to a boat in the west.&nbsp;That railroad took immigrants from the boarder to where ever they wanted to go.The immigrants that came to the U.S came because they experienced difficult punishments. Others came in very harsh conditions to start over.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1848 John Shutter found gold that when the word got out &nbsp;it attracted many immigrants.His secret got out and when it did the Chinese came to get it. The Chinese came because they thought that they would find good fortian. They also came to get away from the war that distorted their crops.That is why immigrants came to America to forget the past or to star over.&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022151057	2363	1		20131022151012	2352	1

Some people didn't have a choice because Europe had so many people there wasn't any jobs or food for them. It was either starvation or come to America.

There were many hardships in their home country, so the people came to America in search of freedom. These people were from Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Russia. They were also from Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and China. People came to escape wars, poverty, and prejudice. They also came for wealth and the benefits of living in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jews from Russia, Germany and Poland came to America in the 1800s. All of them came for religious freedom. In their home countries, Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs. They left to escape prejudice and prosecution. Jews didn't know much about America, but still came. Their home country had pogroms, or organized violent attacks to get rid of the Jews. All they wanted was to make a new life for themselves and their family in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many benefits in moving to America in the 1800s. One of the benefits was the industry growth. In 1869, the first railroad was completed. This made it easier to carry goods like lumber and silver. People also traveled on the trains, because the trip was easier and shorter. Information traveled faster due to the new printing press. People were able to print newspapers and inexpensive books. In 1844 the telegraph was invented, and in 1876, the telephone was invented. News and ideas were available to more people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushes and pulls were what made the immigrants want to move. The features that attracted people were the pulls. Some pulls were wealth, jobs, and opportunities.Other pulls were access to resources and perceived freedom. The features that drove people away from their homes were pushes. Some pushes included harsh environments and wars. There were also, other conflicts poverty. Due to the rapid increase in the number of people in Europe, the pushes were made worse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were 4,096,753 immigrants in America, in 1860. In 1910, there were 13,344,545 immigrants in America. All the immigrants came from different countries. They all left for different reasons. What they did have in common though, was that they were strong-willed people. They wanted to have a good life for their family and themselves, without judgement in what they believed in.</p>	2		20131022151023	2367	2		20131022151004	2352	2

With all of the new technology being invented, there was plenty of things that immigrants could do if they came here for work, wich a lot of immigrants did. They could work in factories and so on.</p> <p>People also immigrated for food. 1.7 million irish men,women, and children came to the U.S. in need for food because the crops were dying and there was a major food shortage. Others immigrated for religious reasons. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the new Europeans immigrated because they wanted to escape the harsh living conditions that they had to suffer through in their home country.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848, there were a rapidly increasing number of peopl in the United States, becase shortly, many people from all over the world found out about the gold in California. That was the beginning of the California Gold Rush. Thorsands of people came in order to find gold and wealth. By 1870, 63,000 Chinese people were in the U.S. looking for gold. Even though others were just in the Unites States to live there 77% of them were in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years mabny people ahve immigrated to the U.S. in order to do many things.

They struggled through the difficult sea, leaving there family and sometimes dieing to get to America. The trouble was unbearable before they came to America too. They had diessees, plagues and major sicknesses and sometimes war. I'm proud of the immigrants because anyone here could be apart of a immigrant family. I bet if immigrants didn't come half America's population would decrease.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigrants came to America for various reasons. Most immigrants came for gold, money, and work. The work in the 1800's wasn't that good in Italy. The people came here so they could get out of harms way. I mean yes America came be harmful but still it was best for them to leave the their country. In there eyes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1860's - 1910's the American population increased majorly. The number of daily papers almost doubled. The American population almost tripled. The immigrants were mostly happy when they got to America. Some were sad because they lost their families. The immigrants weren't always hoping to go to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the immigrants were born they weren't called immigrants. They were regular people. The country they were in depended on what type of immigrant you were like if you were from Germany you would be called a German Immigrant. If you were from Italy you would be called a Italian immigrant. The immigrants were very curious coming to America. They wanted to know what was what. Some stuff they knew. Some not really, but the immigrants learned.</p>	1		20131022151023	2367	2		20131022151055	2363	1		20131024171018	2405	1

In their countries they might've been mistreated by the way they looked, thought, or what they believed in. As a result, they moved to free land in Oregon.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further into the 1800's, great change happened. More immigrants arrived to America and the transportation improved. They built their first railroad track in 1869 that crossed the United States wich also helped people who caried resources get to another place quicker.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848 they discovered gold. Soon after the secret broke out, thousand of people had come to be apart of the gold rush. In the following year, even more people showed up. Including those people were the Chinese men.

Whether they wanted jobs or wanted freedom. Everyone came for their own reason. They were all suffering and just waiting to get out of that jail cell they called home. Luckily, they found America. The place that answered all of their problems. &quot;Why did they come?&quot; you might ask. Here's why.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many different reasons. One of them is: oppurtunities. People were attracted to having oppurtunites. Their own homes didn't have as much oppurtunites as America. America was their hero.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason why people came to America is because they needed jobs. The Irish were desperate for jobs because their crops had failed. They needed to support their family, but how? The answer was simple: America.&nbsp; How would they get what they needed without jobs? They came to the U.S. for jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, people came to America because they needed food. Without a job, how could they pay for food? In Ireland, more than 1 million people died of starvation. Can imagine that? Having no food is terrible. That's why they came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, they came beacuse they wanted freedom. Russian Jews left because of harsh conditions. They hade to escape prejudice and persecution. People discriminated them because of their beliefs. What would they do? Where would they go? They went to America. In America they could wander around without being discriminated. That is why they came.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, people came because they wanted wealth. People from around the world heard about California and its gold in 1849. They wanted to find gold and become rich. Chinese migrants from Guangdong who couldn't pay for their homes came to America in search for gold. California became known as &quot;The Golden State.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, many people came for many diffrerent reasons. For wealth, food, jobs, and oppurtunities.

People kept coming on ships after ship after ship they all came in time. In 1800s with all the new technology there was a lot to do back then. The people were needed to make new factories to build on the empty land. They needed to invent things and all the immigrants did that. Germans made groups of immigrants in the 1800s it was the largest single group there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also large Irish immigrant groups they all wanted to help. Right before the American civil war in the 1860s,one-fourth of the whole population of Irish people came to the u.s. The Irish people were very desperate because their crops had failed.They were&nbsp; very desperate when they found out that their potato crops had failed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 1 million people died of starvation Ireland. Later in the, 1800s people came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All the left over people needed homes, jobs, and food. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others came for freedom these included people from Holland, Jews who came from Germany.People just came to avoid the wars and escape them.&nbsp; In total of all the people 26 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. Thats why they wanted freedom and a chance at work. Jews were also mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transportation improved the first railroad was made it crossed the U.S. The railroad was first finished in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber. They could move these items from West to East. People traveled for trips from one place to another and it became shorter.</p>	N		20131025161033	2352		N	20131025161033	2368		N

One reason why people immigrated is because people were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Another reason is because their transportation had improved and they wanted to go out and explore the world withoit having to pay to much money. The last reason is because gold was discovered! The gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagrants weren't very rich back in the day. So, when they heard that there was a brand new transportation and it wasen't very expensive they jumped on the oppurtunity. Other people just needed to get a new job to make money and to use that money to take care of their family. Chinese people moved to California for the gold that they have found on John Sutter's property.&nbsp; The population did increase because of all of these events. The number if people in the U.S. in 1860 was 31,513,000 between 1860 and 1910 the population increased to 92,407,000! the biggest increase was in coal production (in tons), it went from 20,471,000 to 417,111,000!&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023141025	2370	1		20131023141026	2365	1		20131024141010	2405	1

In the new technology, there was plenty for then to do. Germans were the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. One fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America (that was 1.7 million Irish people). Later people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of&nbsp; the 1800s was a time of great change. Industries grew and transportation improved. Once the first rail road was completed, it was easier to move resources and people's trips became shorter and easier. The invention of the telegram and telephone only made news travel even faster. The reasons are characterized as &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot;. <b>Pulls</b> are those features that attract people. They include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom. <b>Pushes </b>are those features in life that drive people from their homes. They include harsh environment, wars, conflicts, and poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of Chinese people moved to California because of the gold rush in 1849. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849. Among these &quot;Forty-Niners&quot; were 325 men from China. More Chinese came next year, and the next. They hoped to find a fortune waiting for them. The first wave of Chinese came from Guangdong, an area in China's south coast. The Chinese called California <b>Gam Saan</b> or &quot;Gold Mountain.&quot; By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, there were many things that contributed to the growth in population of the U.S. These included, the pushes, the gold rush, the improvement in transportation, and the new technology. This was a significant time period in history because of the huge increase in the population of the United States.&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023141043	2367	2		20131023141046	2356	2

They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and to build&nbsp; on the land, and to invent. Immigrants did all that.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops failed to grow, especially the potato crop.

Here are some things that happened.</p> <p>&nbsp; Moving To America,</p> <p>During the 1800s, working people could build, farm,and invent came to America. The new technology that was produced in the 1800s there was plenty more for them too now. they were need to manage factories or build things. the immigrants came in handy for that. Germans were the largest group single to immigrate to America. Before, the American civil war in the 1860s a fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. All the people that came caused a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Now, in the later 1800s people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included many countries like Russia, Italy, and Poland. Lots of the Northern European countries.&nbsp; The population doubled between 1750 and 1850. Many of the Europeans came to America to find work that would help them avoid hunger.&nbsp; many others came for religious freedom this included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total some 26 million immidrants arrived in the united states over a 50 year period.</p> <p>&nbsp; Changes in America; pushes and pulls</p> <p>The second part of the 1800s was a great change in america.

There are many reasons why people from other countries wanted to come to America. Other countries are not like America. They don't have amazing oppurtunities and technology like we do here. Countries like Mexico do not have much food like America. They do not have amazing oppurtunity like getting a house. People in other countries do not have as nice as people as in America. Other countries like Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador do not have air conditioning in all houses like in the U.S. There are also better transportation opurtunities. Although there are more better life expieriences in America, now in 2013 the technology and other stuff have been passed down to less fortunate countries.</p>	1		20131023131056	2367	1		20131023131039	2352	1

There were food shortages, and higher birth rates. So with more people and less food, people went hungry. Many people were out if jobs because of more people. The loss of jobs caused poverty, and taxes went up. When they came to America, though, there was plenty of work. The word got around, and people started pouring in.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; People also moved to escape wars. They caused an unsafe and unpredictable lifestyle and home. Others came for freedom. Whether it was religious or not it still promised a happy and free life for many. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Some immigrants came to America to find opportunities and wealth, such as gold. The promise of riches was to great an opportunity to pass by. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; When transportation improved, it just made traveling easier. It was easier, faster, and cheaper to travel by steamship. Which meant more immigrants. The printing press made printing newspapers and books cheaper. The invention of the telegraph and telephone made news travel that much faster. And people come in that much faster. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

The 3 main reasons the 1800's was the start of major population and industrial growth in America is because people needed to move out of crowded countries escape hunger, gain religious freedom, and to have a chance to get rich. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason people move into America was because the countries they were living in were too crowded. The European population had doubled between 1750 and 1850. Europe couldn't handle all the people the had back then. They couldn't proved enough food or jobs for everyone. So, many of them moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people moved to America was to gain religious freedom. These people were often some German, Polands, and Russians Jews because they were mistreated in what they believed in by there home country. Russian Jews left to America to escape the risk of pogrom(organized violent attacks).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last main reason people moved to America was to &quot;strike it rich&quot;. In 1849, news about the California Gold Rush spread to China. About 325 Chinese men came to mine for gold. Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong to flee from conficts between China and Britian. At the time, Guangdong was getting too much people and not enough rice, so they moved. Most of them got gold and returned to China.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In conculsion, the 1800's was a time of major population and industrial growth in America. People came to escape crowded countries and hunger, while others came to gain religious freedom. But in the end, The 1800's was a time of change in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023131052	2352	2		20131023131007	2356	2		20131024131030	2405	2

Well one reason that people moved in 1800s to America was because they went to work. The immigrants worked hard.With all the new technologies in the 1800s there were plenty of work for the people to do. Some people worked in farms, new factories, and other people worked to invent more other things.The people did all that. American excepted that it was a land of freedom but that's what they wanted. People wanted freedom and a chance to work in America. The people had a chance to work with the new technology. People had to work so they could have money and food to eat. People from Europe came to America to work too. Many people from other places went to work to America. The population from America increased a lot because people started to come to America.</p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason that people moved to America in the 1800s was because people wanted freedom and of the new technology. So people started to move to America because of the new technology America had. People could travel faster to America. The advance transportation made more people move to America and for people to travel was easier. The reason people moved often ccharacterized as pushes and pulls.The thing in the 1800s at America were going good and people did not like to suffer so they went to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third reason that people moved to America was because of the exciting news about the Gold Mountain. The news spread throughout China and other places. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. So some people moved to America because about the gold rush. Three hundred twenty-five people joined the gold rush. The America population was increasing more and more. Then more people were joining in the gold rush. The Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. Everyone wanted to join.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s America was so popular and had a lot of population. People just kept going to America. I think that in the 1800s America was the place that had more population. In America people had a lot of things to do like work. First people traveled with ships. Then they traveled in trains and maybe in cars. America was a place of freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, I wrote about why did people move to America. My three reasons are that because they went to work, they had freedom, had new technology, and the gold rush. In the 1800s there were plenty of population. I hope know you understand why did people move to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023131013	2367	2		20131023131019	2365	1		20131024141030	2405	2

If you do, then this article will answer your question.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the article of &quot;moving to America&quot;, one reason is that they came because they wanted to avoid hunger. The Irish were desperate because there crops had failed especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.Int the 1800 people started coming to America people form Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food,homes,and jobs, and there just didn't seem to be enough for them in Europe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the article &quot;Gold Rush! Chinese move to California&quot; it says people also came to America because they wanted to find gold. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. John Sutter tried to keep it a secret but the word spread and soon reached San Francisco,&nbsp; and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. The news spread to the rest of the United States, and to the other parts of the world as well. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed to California. The California Gold rush had begun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In &quot; Changes in America : The pushes and pulls for immigrants&quot;it says people came to America to escape harsh conditions. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form pogroms, organized violent attacks. Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices&nbsp; the tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless.Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved. Immigrants hoped to make a new life foe themselves and there family in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are some reasons why people came to America. I told you that people came to avoid hunger, that People came to look for gold, and that they came to escape harsh conditions.</p>	1		20131023131007	2363	2		20131023131027	2370	1		20131024171001	2405	1

These people came because of hardships in their country, opportunities in America, and of Americas modern technology. The United States is a country that many people immigrated to and this is why.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people immigrated to the United States because of hardships. For example, Russian Jews came from Russia to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of violent attacks. These people came to America to be safe from harm. In addition, Southern Italians suffered from high birth rates, since the traditions was to give land to their first born son, it left many peoples children landless. These people came to America for their children to have a better life. Also, many Europeans came to America to escape conflict and poverty brought on by over crowding. These people came to America to have a better life for themselves and their children. This is the many hardships immigrants faced before they came to America.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to hardships, many people came to America because of opportunities. To show this, people came to America for jobs. Many Europeans came to America to find work, since over crowding in Europe lead to job &quot;shortages&quot;. Furthermore, people came to America to avoid hunger. A food shortage in Ireland killed 1 million people from starvation. People used that as a wake up call to move to a better place with more food. Finally, people saw&nbsp; an opportunity in resources. People packed up their belongings and came to America for more resources for them and their families. A great number of people immigrated to America because of opportunities.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, people immigrated to America because of the new technology in America. For example, from 1860 to 1910 over 200,000 miles of railroad tracks were layed across America which meant for easy travel . In addition to railroad tracks, Over 2,200 newspaper were delivered daily from 1860 to 1910. People found that new technology and the printing press made it easier to get news in America. Lastly, people came to America because of the new technology in factories. Jobs were needed in these factories and immigrants were ready to work. People came to America to get their hands on this new technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, many immigrants came to the United States between 1860 and 1910. The hardships in their own countries &quot;pushed&quot; them here, the opportunities and new technology &quot;pulled&quot; immigrants to come live in America. America was a very promising country to the people between 1860 and 1910.</p>	2		20131023131034	2367	2		20131023131059	2356	2

Those people are called immigrants. They moved away from their homes and most of them went to California. Germans were the largest group that came here. They came to America in the 1800s. The other large group was from Ireland.They both came here because there was a lot of war going on. People were starving and they thought they had a better chance here. Other people from Europe, Russia, Denmark, and China moved to America because of the same reason. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that they all came here, because they heard that they could have freedom and liberty.

They could work in factories, on farms, and invent things. The largest two groups of immigrants was Germans and Irish. Irish came because of crop failures in Ireland. Europeans started coming because needs of jobs, food, and homes. Europe didn't have enough of that over there. But many came for work and food. More came for religious freedom. In Germany, Poland, Russia, and Hollands Jews came. There Jews were punished for their thoughts. Over 50 years a total of 26 million immigrants came.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1800s second half American had a great change. Many immigrants arrived because of the growth in industry. Transportation also got better. 1869 the first railroad was completed that crossed the United States. That made it easier to move lumber and silver from West to East. Boats also improved so it easier to travel to and from America. Printing press was made too. It made it possible to print many books and newspapers. The telephone and telegraph was invented for communication. Immigrants wished to make a better life for them and their families in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In California 1848 gold was found along American River. 1849 travelers headed for California. That began the beginning of the Califonia gold rush. People that looked for the gold were called the &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;. Some of the Forty-Niners were Chinese men. They called California Gam Saan, or &quot;Gold Mountain.&quot; After becoming rich the Chinese went back to China. The Gold Mountain spread throughout China and more Chinese wanted to join the gold rush. The everybody was going to California. 77% of America was in California during the gold rush.</p>	1		20131023121052	2367	2		20131023131012	2352	1		20131025151005	2483	1

It is a free country and provided many jobs in the 1800's. America gives immigrants a chance to start over, give them a new start on life. Its the land of opportunity.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigrants had not much to do in the old country but immigrating to America would change that. There were a lot of new inventions and many jobs. Many new factories were being built which provided many jobs. Also crops grew and gave farmers a chance to get a job. The 1800's was also a big time for inventing. There were many crops for immigrants to farm and to plant crops. Ireland had a record high for immigrants in the farming community. Over one fourth of Ireland's population left to America to farm. (Hakim)</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as immigrating is good&nbsp; it also has the down turns. Just like a ball goes up it also must come down. These are the pushes and the pulls of immigrating to America. For example pulls are the things that attract people in life such as transportation grew and made resources easier to access. Also the telegraph was invented so now people could communicate easier and faster. But there are pushes in life also or what drive people away like the poverty in Europe. Also wars and other harsh conflicts. Many things in Europe &quot;pushed&quot; them away and new technology &quot;pulled&quot; people to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gold Rush was happening in the 1840's which attracted the Europeans and the Chinese. By 1849 many people were on their way to America to find gold. Over 60 ships set sail and thousands of travelers were already on their way. The nickname for these gold miners were the &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;. Many people, especially the Chinese, came to hope to find a fortune in the Americas. More than 70,000 people with high hopes landed on the coast of California. The Gold Rush was a big attraction for many travelers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are many upturns and downturns the Europeans and Chinese made. They may have had a lot of trouble but they made it through. They provide crops, found gold, and made factories. Immigrants are a big part of America society and helped very much.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023121022	2352	2		20131023131033	2367	2		20131025151017	2483	3

People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily helped them even more. In 1848 along the American river in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter although he tried to keep it secret but word got out soon and everyone wanted it. After the discovery over 70,000 hopefull travalers were heading to California along with 1849,60 ships in 1849.Among them came the ''Forty-Niners'' they were 325 men from china and more and more came every day. And soon started fights over gold and rebeliens against the goverment. By the 1870s their were about 63,000 Chinese in the united states.</p>	0		20131023121025	2363	0		20131023121051	2367	1		20131025151025	2483	0

A lot of people needed more freedom and there corps failed. Some different people got treated differently then others because of their beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had ships to travel but it would take days to do it. And some people would die because of starvation and getting sick and not enough water. They would have to drink salt water which would everoprate in your month really fast. And you would end up drinking a lot of salt water.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My school is celebrating Cultural Heritage Day. To tell about the stories that happened in the 1800s. I would like to tell about the difficult they had during that time. One major difficulty they had is they did not have enough land to farm because all of their crops were dieing from crop failed. They also did not have enough work for everyone. And that really hurt the economy. So most people left to get better pay and more and more work.&nbsp; A lot of the countries went into war called the civil war to fight for more freedom. More then 1 million people died. The Chinese government raised taxes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it got even better more thing began to grow. Like the new railroad system easier to travel. And a lot more safe.It would also make it a lot faster to go on. The printing press came out to print newspaper that gave people new ideas and everyone knew about everything in the world. They were steam power and redesigned. They also came u with the telephone that everyone used. To talk to people like 5,000 miles away. Now that is COOL!It makes things travel faster. And a lot more jobs opened up for people. And more freedom to do what they want to do. And believe in. And even more WEALTH! It also helped families not worry about what if they are going to live tomorrow. And they can got to sleep with food. They can eat tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people traveled to different places is China discovered something that everyone wanted it was gold!!! They had people rebel against them for it. It was crazy how much money it could be for. Farmers who were unable to pay taxes had to sell land to get food. They had to produce rice to feed people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a lot more reasons fro why they had to travel but its is to many to name. But a lot of the population grew bigger and bigger. Foe example the number of people i the united states. And how much more babies were being born. It increased by a lot. To celebrate a special is very important to the people that died and to what they gave to us in this world. They gave us new advancements and technology. And a lot more if they wouldn't have done that we would have never had the stuff we had today!</p>	1		20131023121024	2443	1		20131023131050	2363	2		20131025151003	2483	1

During the 1800s, working people who could build, farm, or invent came to America in ship after ship after ship. With all the new technology in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. Immigrants were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Irish men, women, and children kept coming, during and after the war. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next, I am going to talk about Changes in America. The second half of the 1800s was time of the great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved and the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but the new steamships could make the trip much faster. Steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. People became more interested of the world around them and with the ability to travel long distances easily, they moved are more than ever before.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I am going to talk about the Gold Rush! Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man by the name of John Sutter. John tried to keep it a secret but word soon spread to San Francisco, and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. More Chinese came the next year, and the next. Most of this first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guandonb, an area on China's south coast. In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was involved in two wars between China and Britain. The Chinese government raised taxes. Farmers who we're unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. Guangdong's population was growing quickly. The area could not produce enough rice to feed its people, especially when the the floods destroyed the crops.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, the 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just beginning. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then all of a sudden they became a greater number: 2,716 in 1851 and 20,026 in 1852. Although they could be found throughout the country, 77 percent of them were in California.</b></p>	N		20131023121045	2372		N	20131023121024	2368		N					20131025131040	2372		N

Because back then there was ok tecnology so they needed to work in new factories. Well back in 1860's the&nbsp; Irish men, women and children were move because the war was going on. They were moving during and after the war and that was only 1.7 million of the people.Also they were very dis appionted because their crops did not grow and that was a shortage for most of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on the&nbsp; Europeans came to america to find jobs sothat they can get food. As well as Russians,Italians,Polanders,Denmarkers Swedens &amp; Hungaries. But&nbsp; the Jews really didn't treat&nbsp; thier counrty like home. Years past and more immigrants came to america. and that was a 50 year time period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly new comers didn't know much about the US.Such as Mexicans all they spoke was spanish.

The Irish were the second largest group. Other immigrants came from Europe, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Why did they migrate? There were many reasons like shortage of food, better crops, jobs, and freedom. there are many different reasons. Many people wanted to come because of all America had to offer, but some were almost forced. Living conditions in some countries made their lives difficult. To try to improve those conditions, they migrated.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In these times, one big thing was farming. People from Ireland mainly migrated due to farming. Many of their crops had failed, especially the potato crop. This was a big deal because if the crops died, then they would have no food for their families. More than 1 million people died of starvation. Before the war in the 1860's, a part of Ireland migrated to America. There was about 1.7 million Irish people at the time. They kept coming during and after the war. Later in the 1800's, European countries started sending people to America. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Before they migrated, the population of Europe almost doubled to 1,800. They all needed food, homes, and jobs. There was not enough for everyone. They then migrated for jobs and to avoid hunger. Greeks, Portuguese, and Armenians also migrated hoping for new lives for them and their families. People even came because America had religious freedom. People from Holland and Jew who were from Germany, Poland, or Russia. Jews were often hurt or arrested for their beliefs. They figured they would at least have a chance here in America. In total, 26 million immigrates had come to America in a 50 year period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 1800's, America had many improvements. They called these &quot;pulls&quot;. They are features that attract you to people and to socialize. Transportation was a big deal once it improved. They had just created the first railroad. This made it easier to transport resources like silver and lumber from West to East. People were also allowed to travel on the trains. Traveling was now faster and easier. Later there ere trains that could take people straight to boats. Transportation improved even more when the steamship was invented. Migrating to America would usually take months, but now the trip was much faster. News was hard to get around. In 1844, the telegraph was invented. This just made the news travel faster. America really improved over the years!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Although migrating to America helped a lot of people, there were, however, challenges. They called these &quot;pushes&quot;. These included rough environments, wars, poverty, and other problems. These conflicts worsened once the population in Europe increased. Europeans left due to harsh environments. Russian Jews escaped from prejudice,&nbsp; persecution, and violent attacks. Southern Italians faced high birth rates and farming loses because of lower prices.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1848, gold was found along the American River in California by John Sutter. Although he tried to keep it a secret, it soon got out to the people of San Francisco. Many of them left to go to the river. It later spread through the rest of America. By the beginning of 1849, thousands of people were taken by ship to the river. The California Gold Rush had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful adventurers, called the &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;, which had 325 Chinese men among them. This may have seemed like a &quot;pull&quot;, but was also a &quot;push&quot;. Soon the Chinese government raised taxes which made farmers have to sell their land because they could not pay for it. The population had started growing quickly. Soon they could not produce enough rice to feed the people, especially when it flooded. Many Chinese people joined the Gold Rush. This helped fix the problems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023111040	2367	2		20131023121001	2363	2		20131025151030	2443	3

Well, I had.</p> <p>Many people came to start a new land of their own. They needed new soil that will helped them grow their crops. A Lot of other people wanted to invent new things. They thought that this land was gonna chane their lives.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alot has happen since the 1800s begun. The very first railroad in America was completed in 1869. There was also a invention called telegraph and the telephone which was invented in 1876. People around the world heard about the new things invented and moved to America. The word that characterized them were push and pull.<b> Push, </b>means why the people left their countries. <b>Pull</b>, on the other hand means what attrated them to come.For example the Gold Rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gold Rush pulled alot of people from where they live. The man that discovered the gold was John Sutter. He wanted to keep it a secret, but soon the whole world knew. Over 70,000 people came to America in 1849. These people were named '' Forty-Niners.''Some people were hopeless. People from China called California Gam Saan which means ''Gold Mountain.''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Lot of Chinese came to California for gold. Only 325 men were from China in the Gold rush. All of the men from China were from Guangdong. they wanted to go there, make their fortunes, qand return happily to China. the men that went to the gold rush were the beginning of Guangdong. Next Year, More chinese men came. In 1851, 2,716 and 20,026 in 1852. By the 1870s there about 63,00 chinese in America. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Alot had change from the 1860s to the 1910s.

But there was some down sides of that like the disceases they had. Another one was the great war of americal. But also the good part was that they had there freedom. Now let me tell you about those goods and bad.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the bad part of moving to America was the disceases. The disceases killed many people in America. It started when imigrants moved to America. They gave the disceas to the people that lived there and then they die. They couldnt get cured because they didnt have any tecnolegy to find the cure.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second bad part was the civil war when Europe wanted to take America over. The natives didnt want to give America to them because they didnt want America to look like Europe. The war went on for a really long time that took days and months. Many people started to die every day because of the war. But then the war ended and America won and Europe left America alone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The good part was the freedom after the war. People were able to do alot more thing then what they had to do in Europe. In Europe they had to mary the person the king picked for them. The people had to go to a certain church that the king picked for them. People were happy in america because of thier freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So that was what happend in the 1800's. There was a lot of disceases that killed people. There was a civil war between Europe and America. Then more people went to America because of there freedom. So as you can see the 1800's were very intresting to learn and read about.</p>	1		20131023111033	2367	2		20131023121010	2372	0		20131025151055	2483	1

Another reason was in a time were people needed money and America needed production, and America had faster transportation for, people that needed jobs. One more reason is because of the California Gold Rush. It was way people would get jobs and money.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, America needed people to invent things. And there was so many people around the world that came. Some even made ships to transport, instead of Sails they made steam ships. There was also more rail road tracks. It made it easier to transport resources to people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second of, another reason people came to America was a time of money and need jobs. And America needed lots of workers for production. And many people were driven forward by this. And America coal production was massive. Then more people came to America for jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the reason why people came to America was the California Gold Rush. It brought people from all over the world. The whole point of people coming was to make money and settle in America. Another reason was that people bought land. And the benefit to America made a huge population.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole point of this essay is to tell why people came to America. Like the Gold Rush. Or the jobs for people that were poor.

With the ability to move along distances easily, they took advantage of it. Most reasons why they moved often were &quot; Pushes&quot; and &quot;Pulls.&quot; Pushes were things that drove people away, like harsh environment, wars, and other conflicts. Pulls were things that attracted people, for example: jobs, wealth, opportunities, and perceived freedoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many of the new Europeans immigrants wanted to escape the horrible conditions in Europe.

America is full with new jobs, different religions, different languages, and much more exciting things.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s, there were many immigrants that came from all over the world. Some came from Poland, Germany, Ireland, Russia, Italy, Denmark, China, and a lot of other places.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People came to America for freedom, wealth, a new environment, a new life, to escape wars, jobs, opportunities, avoid hunger, crops, and other things.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wealth was one thing that brought very many people to America. For example, in 1848 there was a big gold rush in California. A big amount of people from China came to the gold rush. One year after another, the population of the Chinese going to the U.S. raised higher and higher. Many people from China came to find many different things, but 77% of them were in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason why there were so many immigrants coming were because of people getting out of wars or fights. People were coming to find a new life, without violence. Would you want to live in a place being attacked by bombs, or being beat because of what religion you choose? I don't think anyone would! That's why people came to America! They found safe homes for themselves, and their children.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jews were getting mistreated because of their religion. Everyone is different in some way, so don't treat them differently! People from China came to America to get away from conflicts and poverty. China had 2 wars against Britain in their country. No one wants to live through that! China also had rebellions against their own government! Or they had village or family fights! Who in their right mind would want that in their village? Those are a couple reasons of why the Chinese came to America. Also, when they came to America, they got what they wanted!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People also came because they couldn't pay taxes or their bills. Farmers who couldn't pay their taxes had to sell their land. <b>Where are we going to go</b><b>? </b>the farmers thought. The only place they could think of was America. They got their land and were happy with it. That's what America is all about... making people happy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things were hard in immigrants own countrys, so they came to us...

The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops failed, the potato crop was low, and there was a food shortage. One million Irish people died of starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the later 1800s, people came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The extra people needed food, homes, and jobs, There wasn't enough in Europe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others came for religious reasons. These people were from Holland, and the Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews were mistreated because of their beliefs in their home countries. But, people still came to escape wars that made their life unstable and unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total number of immigrants that migrated to the United States was 26 million over a 50 year time period. Most knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom and chance to work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the 1800s was a great change in America. Industries grew and a lot of immigrants came to Americas shores.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews had left to escape prejudice and persecution in the shape of pograms. Pograms were organized violent attacks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gold Rush started in 1848 along the American River in California. John Sutter discovered it. John tried to keep the gold a secret but the word of the find soon reached San Francisco and hundreds of people left the city to set off for the American River. Quickly, the news spread to the rest of the United States and to other parts of the world. By January of 1849, 60 ships with thousands of travelers were going to California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 70,000 adventurers arrived in California in 1849. These &quot; Forty- Niners&quot; were 32 men from China. More Chinese people came over the next year, and the eastern United States. The Chinese people hoped to find a fortune of gold waiting for them in the California Hills.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the first wave of the Chinese migrants were from Guangdong. Guangdong was in area on China's south coast. They were leaving from conflicts and poverty.&nbsp; In the middle of the 1800s, Guangdong was in two wars between China and Britain. There was also many rebellions against the government and endless village and family feuds. So, the Chinese government raised taxes. The farmers were unable to pay their taxes so they had to sell their land.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 325 Chinese that had joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. Over the next year, 450 Chinese came to California. Then suddenly the came in huge numbers. 2,716 in 1851. 20,026 in 1852. By 1870, there were 63,000 i the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, there were many different types of immigrants in the 1800s. Irish, Germans, Russians, Chinese, Jews. During the 1800s, there was a huge immigrant sprout in America as you can see. The immigrants helped form our country that we have today. They invented things, built things, and created our culture.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131025151017	2368		N	20131025151017	2367		N

In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries such as Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweedan, and Hungary. Many of the people that came to America come to find jobs, and avoid hunger. Others came for religios freedom such as Holland, and Jews that came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total about 26 million immagrants arrived in America over a 50 year period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paragraph will be about the changes in america. The second part of the 1800s was a time of great changes. Indusrty grew and many immagrants arrived in the american shore. Transportation also improved, like the first railroad was completed in 1869. This meant it was easier to move resources like silver and lumber from west to east. People could also travel on these trains too. In the 1800s, there was also rapid and important change in how quickly and widely info traveled. Steam powered ships and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspaper. This made news and ideas available to more people. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paragraph will be about the Gold Rush and why the Chinese move to California. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the proerty of a man named John Sutter. John tried to keep this discovery a secret, but word of the find spread and reach San Francisco, and hundreds of people set of to go to the American River. Word also spread around the world and on January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overload travelers were heading for California and the California Gold Rush had begun.

More Chinese came the next year, and the next. like the people the people who came from the eastern United States. Most of the first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangdong, an area on Chinas south coast.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, alot of events happend in the 1800s and alot of immagrants came to the United States of America.

And when they get tired of staying in that country they do another push factor and move to another country its not because of other people or anything its because of the house thats not liveable for there kids if they have any</p> <p>&nbsp;And thats what a push factor is so all you people that think there moving because of you its not here is somthing to read incase you think of that one day.</p>	0		20131023111007	2368	0		20131023111004	2352	0

Infact most of our country epople had ancestors that were imagrants. In the 1800 many imagrants came to America because they were tring to find a new job or bring there invention to the world. Other people came because of the conflicts in there country.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Europe alot of people in swedian came over the borders because of a potatoe famine that caused many to die. In China people came over because they were in a war with another country called Great Britian. When they came over the ywent to calafornia and started one of the main reasons why people came to west in 1849. The famous Calafornia Gold Rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The people that moved east wanted jobs in citys so that they can support there family but most immagrants didn,t get the best of jobs in the world. They mostlikely worked in factorys or as your neighborhood store clurk.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the middle of the country there is a place called the Great plains. Alot of people moved there for farms and the western Movement. The farms had corn and good natural reasorces that made them a nice profit and gave them alot of money.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conculson, the immagration in the United States increased the population by alot. The immagration caused&nbsp; America to be like it was today and if some people didn,t immagrate you wouldn't be here.&nbsp; So immagration was a good thing to happen.

Even if it's, how we <b>act</b>, how we've <b>changed</b>, or <b>freedom</b>. In the 1800s many people were fighting in the war for their life. People didn't know if it was right or if it was wrong to do all of the things they were doing. Now and days, almost everyday now people still fight over the war, saying its never going to end or in the 1800s it was just the beginning. However, it was not just the beginning for as we know it right now. America has freedom and <b>rights</b> now. Many people, now are confused of what will and is always going to be going on. People have been confused and lately, I've been confused from all the threats we are just suddenly getting again from South Korea. <b>Immigrants</b> and <b>Emigrant</b><b>s</b> are a really big deal today. Immigrants are people who enter the United States. People refer to the &quot;I&quot; in immigrants to refer as &quot;inter&quot; even though it is spelled differently. Also, Emigrants relate to the &quot;E&quot; because if you are an Emigrant that means that you are Exiting that country. It's very easy though to see how much the USA has changed since the 1800s. Then, you can see how easy it is. In the next few paragraphs, you will see how and why the people would move in the 1800s. You may be shocked you may be surprised you may have known these things. It just all depends on what your knowledge is and how you use it. In the next paragraphs also, we are going to see what and how people do stuff like this. It's actually pretty cool to hear/see how they would move if you have to force people to show you how, you can do all of these things and how you can do different things with it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; People now like to go and try new things out by moving. Now we can do push or pull resources. A <b>push</b> is when someone is pushing you to go somewhere like, they are forcing you to go somewhere to move. A <b>pull</b> is when someone is trying to attract you to go somewhere by, telling someone even a two year old that if they move there they'll get them new toys or something. They will think about it and if they say, &quot;yes!&quot; then you can do whatever to it and they'll help you fix whatever you would think you would need. It depends on who you are and what you do if you can do whatever you can to make sure that you know what your doing so it will be more capable to do these kind of certain things that you can do with moving from country to country.Which makes it easier to do certain things with the war going on in the 1800s it was much more reliable to do stuff with people and make sure that we can do many other things with what you think that we are doing in the different time zones. In the next two paragraphs, well the exact next one I'm doing all I am mostly going to be talking about are the &quot;pros&quot; of being an immigrant for a new country. Then, the one after that are going to be &quot;cons&quot; of being and immigrant and moving to a new country and the &quot;pros&quot; of a push and pull. In the third one with the &quot;cons&quot; I also will be talking about &quot;cons&quot; of a push or pull.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pros of being an immigrant a pros of a push/pull. Now, people are trying to decide pros and cons.Pros: you can see more, you can have freedom, not be in the middle of the war. All those are some <b>really</b> good reasons why we are who we are and have done what we have done. We all have different reasons why we are doing what we are doing! We can always make sure we know what we are doing, while we are doing it. We are making sure that it is easier for people to make sure how they do stuff is how we can leave it. So, that it is possible for other people to do these type of things to make it easier for people to do these things so that we can do different things before the end of the war.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Last, it was as if people can do whatever people can do when they are trying to do what they can. People have been very good at this subject since people were doing everything they could to do these things. It's all easy though now when you can do this stuff with people when in the war it was completely different. It's now like people could've done everything they could have! It's really different but,people made it through it!</p>	1		20131023121026	2443	1		20131023121003	2367	2		20131025151048	2405	1

They did not want to go through starvation and illness at the time. Another reason they came is because World War 1. They came to look for food, homes, and jobs-and there just didn't seem to be anough in other countries. A lot of people died during that time.</p> <p>Also, there were other pushes and pulls at the time. Lots of immigrants came to America because of the Gold Rush. They thought that if they came they would find gold and have a better life in America. Which I think is right because there was a lot of gold at the time, which I call, &quot;Butter Nuggets!&quot;</p> <p>Other pushes are like a harsh enviroment, wars &amp; other conflicts, and poverty. There are other pulls like jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedom. A bad thing about leaving your country is that you might not be able to bring everything that you got, leave your family behind, loose your pineapple under the sea, or your pets like my pet that I lost when I moved to the Bakini Bottom. I lost him because he is afraid of water. It was a sad experiance.</p> <p>Back to Immigrants! They also came to America to bulid railroads. So, that's why immigrants moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>P.S. I ate my goldfish!</p>	1		20131025151006	2363	1		20131025151006	2367	1

Aand some EEuropeans live in America today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Europeans were not harmful at all, all they wanted to do was have a better life and made sure that their family's and friends would be okay. All of the EEuropeans had no electricity because, it was the 1800's there was no electricity back then. So when they didn't have any electricity or gas there were no motors. But they did know how to paddle with the paddles. They paddled all the way across the Atlantic ocean just to live in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they were at sea some of them were sea sick. A lot of them died because they got decease that can kill you and hurt you badly. Plus they starved from the little food and water that they had. But still a lot of them made it to America and survived without dieing but some still got sick.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they got to America they were so happy and they all ate some thing. Then after that America increased the population from 20,471,000 and now with the Europeans it cudropled&nbsp; 92,407,000. That's a lot of people that moved to America. Yep that's a lot of people who moved from Europe to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even though some of their family's died and i know its sad but there was nothing they could have done excepted that they were all going to die but they were lucky that they didn't.

Peoplembecame more aware of the world around them with the ability to move long distances easily. European immigrents wanted to escape harsh conditions in europe.

They migrated to America for better crops, food, work, money, and a better live. The total of immigrants that migrated to America is at lest <b>26 million </b>or more that came for a better live for themselves, and for their families. Even till now there is still immigrants.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1869 the first railroad that crossed the US (United States) was completed. This meant it was easier to find more resources like silver and <u>lumber </u>from the West to the East. Now it was easier for people to travel to place to place. In 1844-1876 telegraph and telephones were made. In time new tech and transportation will be made.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848 gold was discoverd along the rivers of CA (Califirnia) on the property of a man named John Sutter. By Jan 1849&nbsp; 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for CA, it became a gold rush. 325 men from China more of them came in the next year most came from Guangdong.

These immagrants and and all of these changes, have transformed America into the oustanding country its today .</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin with,&nbsp; Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's. People started coming from other European countries, this included Russia Italy, Poland, Denmak , Sweeden and Hungary. All of those people came for a reasoon though. For example, food , jobs , homes and alot more.&nbsp; Others came for religious freedom. Especially Jews becasue they where mistreated for there religon. Also, some cameto escape wars that made there life unstable and unpredictable. Those are some very good reason to immigrate to America. In all 26 million immagrants arrived in the USA over a 50 year period! Thats crazy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the second half of the 1800's was a great change. Immigants arrived and insdustry grew, transportation improved meraculosly. People could now travel here by boat, train and car. The invention of the telegram made it easier to communticate with relatives and friends. Many European immigrants wanted to escape the harsh conditions found in Europe. Also, some Jew where attacked, just because of there religions. Southern Italtians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses due to lower prices. They all went to see if they could find a better life here in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Finally , the gold was discovered, and the Chinese moved to California. A man named John Sutter was the person who discovered gold. He tried to keep it a secret that he discovered it, but soon after ther word reached everywhere. Hundreds and thousands of people left to see if they could strike it rich. By January of 1849, 60 ships carrying over thousdands of followers where headed to California. It started a boom town , the gold rush had begun. The Chinese came a few years following after the gold rush. They came because of pverty, food and taxed. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the USA and they played a critical part in building the transcontinential railroad.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; In conclusion, there are many reasons why immigrants traveled to America during the 1800's. Each immigrant group has a different story to tell, and they have all played a big role in American history.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023111004	2367	2		20131023111036	2363	1		20131025151046	2483	1

Do you ever wonder why those people decide to move America? There is always a reason or more why immigrants, people from different countries that move to America, decide&nbsp; to move to America. Here are some reasons why the immigrants decide to move to America. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people from different countries decided to move to America because of a &quot;push&quot;. A &quot;push&quot; is something that drives someone from their home.What can cause a &quot;push&quot; is a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts,and poverty. One of the main things that can cause a &quot;push&quot; is that if there is a large population of&nbsp; people in where ever you live . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason immigrants decided to move to America is because of a &quot;pull&quot;.&nbsp; A &quot;pull&quot; is something that attracts people. An example of a &quot;pull&quot; is a job,wealth,opportunities,access to resources,and perceived freedoms.If you go to America you will be sure to find all of this sometimes if you try your hardest. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A reason why people from different countries moved to America is because of something that happenned in California. What happened in California is the Gold Rush. Many immigrants came to America because they wanted some of the gold. Over 63,000 people came because they heard aabout the Gold Rush. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023111007	2372	1		20131023111016	2367	2		20131025151031	2443	1

The population increased by over 26 million in America, mainly because of the immigrants. There was a lot of immigration in the 1800s. This was especially in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People were pulled to America by jobs and wealth mainly. Other reasons were hunger, freedom, and access to recources. For example, the Irish were the biggest group of immgrants to come to America. Many Europeans were pulled to America because they needed to find work and also avoid being starved. Others were pulled to the U.S. because of religious freedom. For example, Jews had come from Russia, Poland, and Germany because the were mistreated for beliefs. The Chinese were pulled to America because of the Gold Rush in Califronia.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others were pushed from their homes by many reasons. Some immigrants came to America because they wanted to escape from wars in their countries. This also refers to the Jews because there was a war starting in Germany because of their religous beliefs. The Irish were the largest group of immigrants to come to America. They were pushed to America by the failing crops and a famine beginning in Ireland.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are mainly the reasons that people had migrated to another country. Basically, they were pulled or pushed because of reasons like wealth, finding jobs, freedom, and hunger. People were really smart to migrate to another country because they could have died if they did not. Immigration was an important part of history and we would not have this great of a country without all of the different cultures we can learn about and so can they.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023111033	2363	2		20131023111029	2352	2

Jews were horribly mistreated.

So when they heard that gold was being found in California they thought that can settle to migrate to come to California for the gold so the Chinese and others would come. So that's why the people decided to come to America to get the gold and to also get a better society they can follow and get more money. </b></p>	0		20131023111019	2363	1		20131023111001	2352	0		20131025151015	2405	0

In order to provide for their family they had to get a job. So they imagrated to the United States to go looking for a job. Many imagrants were so happy to find jobs and be able to eat great food. These imagrants imagrated from all over the world. They wanted to have a good life so they came to the USA.</p> <p>Next, is freedom, they wanted their own beliefs. They wanted to have their own religious beliefs they did not want to be told what to believe in. Also, they did not want to be held back any longer they did not want to follow so of these silly laws. In some countries if the king did not like you he could kill you, but in America you could get a fair chance.</p> <p>Now, is they did not want to be held back, They wanted to be free like I said in my last paragraph. They did not want to be bossed around all they wanted was to have a great life, have a family and more. They were treated cruel in their countries for no reason.

No country had the freedom we did. We let our citizens talk how they wanted&nbsp; do what they wanted and even have there own religion. So we obviously we had freedom in our country.

Our gold rush mostly attracted the Chinese. In two years there was over 63,000 Chinese people in America. The Chinese are the ones who built most of the first railroad. The Chinese were very hard working people that would do any thing for the gold by the American River.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least I'm going to tell you about how we had jobs at this time. China, Germany, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, and the rest of Europe did not have any jobs. So they all came to America where there was jobs and money and places to live. The only job Europe had was sailing a boat and giving out tickets to got to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all you now see why the population has grown in America.

There are many advantages and disadvantages for moving to another country. Some advantages are that your country might have a food shortage so you could move to a different country that doesn't have a food shortage, there might be a really bad disease going around that's deadly and you wouldn't want to get it, or there might be a better job opportunity. Some disadvantages are: moving to a different country could be hard because you would have to sacrifice leaving family and friends, finding a job or a way to get money, not knowing the same language as the people in the country that you moved to, transportation, or the different time and climate changes that your body isn't used to. Now, lets see how people in the 1800s managed to do this, and why.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s, many people migrated to America. There were many reasons why they did. Some did so that they could build, farm, or invent new things. The largest group of immigrants were the Germans, and then the Irish. Many of the Irish people migrated to America just before the Civil War, there was about 1.7 million families that came at this time. They came because there was a food shortage in Ireland so people were dieing. Many other countries came to America for this reason as well. Some other people came because of there religious beliefs[the Jews] because they were mistreated because of what they believed in.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the later 1800s, America started to have many changes. Many things started to improve, and many more things were invented. Transportation improved, the telephone was invented,and printing books and newspaper became less expensive. Then, in the mid 1800s, gold was soon discovered.&nbsp; In the next year people from everywhere around the United States and other countries heard about it and soon went to California for gold. This is when the Gold Rush began.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this is how and why immigrants migrated to America in the 1800s. For gold, jobs, because of prejudice people in there country, and many other reasons. So, now we know why all this happened!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023101015	2363	2		20131023111025	2372	2

Mostly&nbsp; it's not bad at all. An immigrant is a person or group of people that move from there home to a new home in a different country. Usually when a person immigrates it's because of a&nbsp;<b> </b>pull or a push but that's something we are going to look at that more later.</p> <p><b>Pull </b></p> <p>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When someone is pulling something you are bringing something to you or attracting something to you. That's pretty much what in this case a pull is. A pull is when something amazing has happened or is happening. For example in 1848 all over the American&nbsp; River was gold and John Sutter found it. Not long after word broke out that Sutter struck gold! This news was sent all the way to San Francisco and soon the gold rumor got all the way to China. This news attracted or pulled the Chinese to America. in only the first year 325 men immigrated to California.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Push </b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A push is a lot like a pull but still very different. unlike the pull a push is when something is going terrible wrong in there own country and they have no choice but to immigrate. when the immigration from China came from Guangdong. Many of the lands in China where not producing good crops and the Chinese Government started raising taxes. So the people had to move or that would be the end for most of the Chinese. They moved to the US to restart there life and face new problems.</p> <p><b>What is immigrating?&nbsp; &nbsp; </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in the long term an immigrant is jest someone that moves from one country to the next because the want to or even have to. So stop thinking that immigration is bad. The most likely where <b>pulled</b> in by freedom to work or <b>pushed</b> out of their own country because of a bad cause. Immigrants are not as comon as they did in the 1800's but there are still some today. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

During this time technolgy has grown for instance, there was the redsign of the print and press, the telgraph, and telphone.There were other reasons other than industrial advances such as religious fredom and ect.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The groups who first came to America other than George Washington and his followers. After word got out about the country of freedom more people came some where 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. They came because their crops failed, but the single largest group that came where the Germans. In the later 1800's&nbsp; people started coming from European countries that had not come yet such as, Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary all these people to ind work and avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom for instance Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia that was 26 million who came in 50 years.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the other reason this was a time of change in America the indusrial revoltion. Transportation had improved. The first rail road that stopped at America this ment it would be able to be easier to move matrials and form people to move. The first steam ships where first invented and the steam powered redsign of the printing press was invented which made books less expensive. Now news were available to more people. People learned more about the world around them and being able to go places far away more quickly they moved more than ever. These resons are often refered to as pushes and pulls pushes make people leave or abandon there home pulls make people want to go to that place.Some pulls where jobs, wealth, oppertunties, acess to recources and precived freedoms. Some pushes were harsh enviroment, wars other conflicts, and poverty. When people from other counrnties got fed up with there pushes they came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848 gold there was a discovery along the Americian River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. He tried to keep it a secret, but cat was out of the bag and every one came to have there luck at finding gold. By January 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travlers were headed to America, and the gold rush had begun more than 70,000 travlers came in 1849. Among these Forty-Niners were 325 men from China Every year more Chinese came to find a fortune. The Chinese also came because of pushes such as conflicts property and at the time China was at war with great Britian also taxes and ect. But when people heard af tales of gold in America they quickly migrated to California<b> Gam Saan, </b>or gold mountian they wanted to find gold then come back to China. The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush were only the beginning. In 1850, 450 more Chinese came then there were; 2,716 in 1851, 20,026 in 1852.

Germans where the largest group to move and the Irish was right next to them.They wouldn't stop coming because the Irish where desperate from all their crops where failing.Later, once there was a great food shortage more than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. Many started coming from European countries, but others came for religious freedom. Then over a 50 year period there where over 26 million immigrants where in America. Now in the second half of the 1800's begins with the new inventions and progress of the immigrants. They now made transportation so much easier like the train. It got people everywhere so much faster.Same with print and press. It was a tool for newspapers and just paper.Some of the reasons why other immigrants from Russia and others was to escape the persecution and mutiny.</p> <p>Now we are getting into the part where there was an amazing rush for a very valuable mineral or rock.It was at the time of the Gold Rush.It was first discovered in 1848 along the American River in California.When someone couldn't keep his mouth shut spilled thew news that there had been gold in the river, and a whole lot of it.More than 70,000 people came to America in 1849. Among all these people there was 325 Chinese people at the time.Some where coming to escape poverty and conflicts all the time.The government raised taxes in china and farmers had to sell their land just to survive.People felt hopeless from the tales of gold across the pacific ocean.Soon California was named &quot;Gold Mountain&quot;. The 325 of the Chinese was only the start.Then they came in greater numbers. 2,716 in 1851. and so on. By 1870, there where 63,000 Chinese immigrants in the United States.They helped a great part in railroads although only 77% are found in California.</p>	1		20131023101056	2443	1		20131023101004	2363	1

There are many reasons why people traveled to America, some people came to farm, some came for safety, some came because they wanted to find work, a home, and food, and some came to seek a fortune for themselves.

When immigrants come to America by push, it means they are coming to escape from something. Some examples of what people might want to escape are, poverty, harsh environments, wars, and other conflicts.When immigrants come to America by pull, it means that they have been drawn to something. Examples of what immigrants might be drawn to would be, jobs, wealth, opportunities, freedom, and the Gold Rush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1848, a man named John Stutter found gold on his property.&nbsp; The word spread quickly, and soon, immigrants from all over the world were being pulled into the U.S. by the chance of striking it rich. Most of the immigrants came from China. The reason why so many traveled to California, is because taxes were being raised, and many of the people started rebellions. Since many peoples homes were no longer safe, they went to the Gold Mountain with hope. The 1800's and the early 1900's were a very important time in our history.</p>	2		20131023101040	2352	2		20131023101017	2367	2

Like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well the reason why people were so crazy is because of technology. People who could farm, build, and invent things came just in time. Work needed to be done fast so all the immagrants came cause they did all that work. Germans were the biggest group of immigrants.Next were the Ireland people They were so desperate because in Ireland their crops had failed. They were so short on food more than one million people died of starvation. The reason Eurpean people came is because they needed food, homes, and jobs badly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also inAmerica the industry grew big time. Once the immagrants heard that they rushed on over to America. Also transportation improved too. The first railroad that crossed the United States had finished and this was to move things like silver and lumber. People could also ride in this train too to make transportation go alot faster than it did. They also made the new steamships to make transportaion even faster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most biggest reason people came to America was the GOLD RUSH. There was this guy who was named John Slutter and when he went down to the river. He seen a gold shiney thing in the shape of&nbsp; nugget. John tried to keep it a secret but some how in San Francisco the word got out. So millions of people came to the river hoping to find gold and become rich. More than seventy thousand people came to America. After the gold rush happened in stead of&nbsp; Gam Saan they named it Gold Mountain</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why a lot of people came to America. I named three of the most important things why a lot of people came to America. If you want to learn more do some resaerch of your own and get more ways people came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023101001	2363	1		20131023101050	2367	2		20131025151009	2405	1

Irish also made the second most largest group of immigrants. One-fourth of the population in Ireland came to America. That was almost 1.7 million Irish men,women, and children. Irelend crops had failed that mede the men desprate. About 1 million people died because of food lost and starved to death.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Europeans came to America to find work and avoid hunger. The extra people needed food,homes, and jobs. Other came to America for freedom. Other people came to escape wars which made life uneast to live in. Most people whanted to live in America but there was not to much to offer.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see life wasn't easy back then it was hard. Later in time inventions started to occur which increased their way of life. One of their inventions was the telegragh which was invented in 1844. Years later in 1876 telephones were invented. Telephones were used to comunicate with others.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese immigrants had come to California in search for gold.

There were lots of job opprtunities and there was freedom the crops were also doing well there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><b>Job oppourtunites</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many immigrants moving to america because there were many job oppurtunities. There were many chinese people that went to a river in calofornia for hope of finding gold down in a gold-rich river, and many other americans came to the river for hope of finding gold. The industries were also gaining money. Many people from around the world were working at the big industries in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><b>Freedom</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing people from around the world wanted most was freedom. America was the place to go there was freedom and there was lots of money to be made. Many parts of the world didnt have freedom at this time but America had won the war for independence from Britain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><b>Conclusion</b></u></p> <p>As you can see there many reasons why people from around the world would want to move there. There was job opportunities, freedom and America had a good army, it was protected and was a more or less rich country. These are the reasons why there was so many immigrants traveling to America.</p>	1		20131023101004	2367	2		20131023101031	2368	1		20131025151047	2405	1

That is what the people who came to America faced. They faced many hardships while moving to America, they had reasons why they moved to America. The pilgrims left their original country because of the hardhsips they faced over there. While coming to America, they faced lots of difficult times, but they kept going because they saw a new life and lots of money ahead of them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s, people who knew how to build, farm, or invent came to America. Lots of people came to America. The Irish sent a fourth of their entire population to America. The Irish came becausde the crops had failed in Ireland and 1 million people died from starvation. Lots of people also came to Europe, and Europe couldn't feed all those people, so they had to send them away to America. Many others also came for religions freedom. Most of those people came from Holland or were Jews. About 26 million people came to America from 1860-1910.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America had a great boost in inventions when immigrants came. America had a railrooad system for transportation to become easier. They also invented steam power and the printing press. They even made a telegraph in 1844 and a telephone in 1876. People wanted to come to America because they got jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to reasources, and perceived freedoms. They also could move away from places with harsh enviornment, war and other conflicts, and poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gold Rush also attracted lots of people. Gold was discovered in 1848. News spead and millions of people came in 1849. All these peopel were called &quot;Forty Niners.&quot; Among them were 325 Chinese men.

There are over 1000 immigrants that had tried to take over the U.S. The U.S. got payback on them. they stopped trying to take over the U.S. They gave up on trying to get more power on the U.S. The American won the immigrants lost.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the&nbsp; beginning. the total amount of people is 63000.

Many people wanted to join the gold rush. People felt hopeless and they listed closely to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean.

China couldn't produce enough food and rice to feed people when floods hit and destroyed crops. Others needed to escape war, hunger, floods, and hatred.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; These are reasons why immigrants moved from their countries to be in the United States of America.

People had different reasons, but these are the main reasons they moved all over the globe to the U.S.A specifically.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, 1.7 million+ people came to America before and after the war. The Irish were desperate because their crops failed and because they had a food shortage, a million people died of starvation. In the later 1800s, European countries that hadn't sent many people to America before kept on coming to America. The population doubled in Europe. All the extra people needed food, homes, and jobs so they came to America because Europe didn't have enough. Other people from Holland, Poland, Russia, and Jews from Germany came for religious freedom. In total, twenty six million immigrants arrived in the United States over a fifty year period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the 1800s was a great time of change for America. Industry grew and many new immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved, like the first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. So people can move to places faster. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 made news travel faster. People became more aware of the world around them and with the ability to move long distances easily, they moved more than ever. The harsh environment, wars, and other conflicts, and poverty drove people away. Jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms attracted people.</p>	2		20131023101025	2367	2		20131023101059	2443	2

These countries like Italy, Poland, Denmark etc.Some others came for religious freedom, especially Jewish people, because they weren't treated nicely.

The irish were desperare because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland.</p> <p>In the 2800s, people came from other European countries that had not sent mny people to America before.

They wanted to get away from the wars so it wouldn't disturb their families.</p> <p>The last reason why I think they came is because, they wanted freedom. They wanted fairness, freedom, and a chance to work. So they came to America. For freedom without anyone telling them what they can and cannot do so therefore I think they mostly came is because...</p> <p>America has Freedom,Fairness.Good crops and are sure to make people healthy. It's their getaway from the wars that they're scared of. So they come to America, To get away from it all. They all have a chance of getting a job so they work. Not because someone is telling them what job they HAVE to have but because they just want freedom a chance to pick their own job.So they come to American, Great jobs, Great crops, Freedom, Speech, Education. America had it all.They wanted their Family to have great lives, so they chose America.</p>	1		20131024091008	2367	1		20131023091003	2443	1

According to the text, one purpose is the condition in your homeland like for instance a stable food supply or for new jobs. For example, in ireland, the crops had failed and people died of starvation. A example of people needing jobs is that, America have more jobs because of the new inventions so people immigrant there. In other words having a lack of food will let you suffer and die of hungerness. Also if the weather conditions are bad, your body will change and get diseases that are sometimes uncureable.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example, is that some places like America have good transportation or other resources like paper and good weather conditions. This example means that, people who are tired of waiting a long time to go to one place to another can come to America to go to places faster. By having faster transportation, people will have more time for other needs and important jobs. Also by having good resources of paper, you can read newspapers that are printed out and lots of books.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, most of the people who immigranted to America, wanted freedom. By having freedom, people can do whatever they like and not be slaves for one another. Freedom makes people's lives happier and fun than sad or depressed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, moving to America is not a bad thing and can make you and your family's lives happier and joyful. America&nbsp; has freedom to enjoy with you and your family. this is why people immigranted to America in the 1800.</p>	1		20131024091010	2367	1		20131023091021	2352	1

A total of about 26 million people came to the USA over about a 50 year period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of the 1800's was the time that changed the most. Factories grew and many immagrants came to the USA. Lots of transportation inproved, as did comunication. The first railroad that crossed the US was completed in 1869. The telegraph was invented in 1844 and the telephone was invented in 1876. The second half of the 1800's was a great time of change in America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1848, in Sutters Mill. More thn 70,000 hopeful people arrived at America. The men were called the forty-niners, because of the year. only 325 Chinese workers were sent from China, but more and more were sent each year. Lots of excitement spred through China during the Gold Rush. 77% of the country was founde in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are some of the reasons lots of things changed in America. Lots of things were invented that helped change the US.</p>	2		20131023161055	2367	2		20131023161000	2483	2

But before we have some fun I have to ask a couple of questions!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Did you that California was the biggest place to gold mine in the 1800's?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Have you ever done research on America?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Did you know that people came from everywhere to live here? (even from china)</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Did you know that Germans made up up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800's?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Did you know that before the Civil War in the 1860s one fourth of the whole population came from Ireland?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The America is so old it is crazy but no one discovered it until the 1800s. But in the Americas many good things have happened any many bad things have happened too. Some good things would be the gold rush. The finding of America!! I could go on and on and on but I'm not because I do not have all day. But some of the bad things are the great depression, all the hardship. Again i could on all day but I'm not. So anyways The America is a very amazing place!</p>	1		20131023161020	2363	1		20131023161040	2483	1

Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group, one-fourth of the people from Ireland came to America. They kept coming during and after the Civil War. In the later 1800s, more people from Europe arrived to America to find work and to avoid hunger. Other immigrants came for religious freedom like the Jews.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second half of the 1800s was a time of great changes for America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived. American transportation improved after the first railroad was built. It became easier to travel and to ship resources to other places. There was also a rapid change in how quickly messages traveled. Steam power and the redesigning of the print press made it possible to print books and newspapers. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 was also a big improvement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1848 gold was discovered along the American River in California and hundreds of people set for the American River. By January, ships of thousands of travelers were heading for California.</p> <p>Many of the people hoping to strike it rich were Chinese immigrants. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States but 77% of them were in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many immigrants have traveled to America in the 1800s.

I would like to recognize stories of immigrants who immigrated over the last 200 years. Several facts and information will be explained why immigrants immigrated to America in the following article.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s, many immigrants immigrated to America to escape slavery, finding opportunities, and religious cultures. Before the American Civil War in the 1800s, one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. Ireland crops had failed, especially potato crops, which caused more than one million people starve. In the later 1800s, people started to come to America to find jobs, avoid hunger, find homes, and find opportunities. Other immigrants came for religious freedom that included Holland and Jews. In total, over&nbsp; 26 million immigrants arrived in America over a 50 year period. This information would explain why immigrants immigrated to America.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secong half of the 1800s was a great time in America because their industries grew and many immigrants arrived in the U.S. As industries improved, transportation improved as well. Many workers completed the first railroad that crossed the United States at 1816, which caused to attract many immigrants to travel to America. Also, this meant that it was easier to move food stocks, lumber, and other resources. Travelers now could catch a train to America or ride a boat. Soon the population of America rapidly changed and widely information traveled. Steam power was soon invented and the printing press made it possible to print inexpensive books. Then, people became aware that they could get jobs, wealth, opportunities, and develop resources. Some immigrants fro Europe wanted to escape harsh conditions and moved to America. Russian Jews left there homes to&nbsp; escape prejudice and persecution. There are much more reasons why immigrants immigrated to America, but these some main reasons why.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California by John Sutter. Sutter kept his discovery a secret, but the word soon got out that gold was discovery. Other parts of the world found out that gold was discovered in San Francisco in California, so people quickly reached California to find wealth, which caused the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush was mostly involved with the Chinese. The Gold Mountain stories were spread throughout China and caused the Chinese to join the Gold Rush. As the Chinese arrived at California, the population of California increased by 77% and most of them were Chinese. When time passed, the population of America multiplied from 1860 to 1910 and as a result about 92,407,000 people lived in America at 1910. In the following years people wondered how immigrants ended up living in America, well these are some reasons why they are.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, many immigrants had different reasons why they immigrated to America, well they may wanted freedom, wealth, or even jobs. As conclude my essay on why immigrants immigrated to America, people had tough choices to go through whether immigrating to another country or staying.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023151051	2483	2		20131023161030	2367	2		20131025101053	2405	3

Pulls are things that pull people in like trains, jobs, food, or any thing you would want. Some people immigrate a lot because of work or other things.

A good example of the country that experienced a major famine was Ireland.&nbsp; what happen is that their main crop, the potato, started to stop growing, which means a major supply of Ireland food was cut off.&nbsp; This resulted in as much as 1.7 million Irish to move to America.&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, we see that immigrants moved to America because of conditions in the homeland, but did anything else persuade them to move here?&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes! job opportunitys played a big role in immigrants moving here. not least of which being the great Californian gold rush, which, resulted in over 70,000&nbsp; asains moving here for gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did the prospect of making millions in gold get people to move here, but the railroads did too. 63,000 of those 70,000 came to work on the transcontinantal railroad.&nbsp; good, we have seen the gold, railroads, and&nbsp; homeland conditions have persuaded people to come here, but has anything else?&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Again, we say yes, other things have influenced immigrants making the decsion to move here. One big one was religous freedoms. An example of peopel moving becasue of thier beliefs was russian jews, who were mistreated becasue of what they believed in.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conslusion, we&nbsp; see that&nbsp; homeland conditions, the prospect of gold, and other things have influenced immigrants moving to america. now, i leave you, and hopefully you have been entertained and have hopefully learned something.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023151048	2443	1		20131023151006	2367	2		20131025111035	2405	1

People who could build farms or ivent ships.Germans and Irish people were the largest group.Before the American Civil War one fourth of the whole population came to America. States were free on those times there was war and those who lived by left their country to protect their chieldrens. In the later 1800 people started comming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. By that time there were other religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. In total , some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over 50 year period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second half of the 1800 was a time of great&nbsp; change in America. industry grew and many immigrants arrived on Americas shores. Those were hard times for immigrants to get jobs, money, or homes. So they used trains to travel all around to find a place to live. They became poor and finished everything they had done by that time they never finished what they started on. From those times now their was pulls and pushes. Pulls are those feutures of life that attract people.Many European immigrants wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. Immigrants hoped to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States. These advances in transportations made it possible for more people to travel more easily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California. The gold got more valiable during time everything became hard to find while they waste things. Now China had a full of gold and was the first one to. The gold rush started at China.It made alot of immigrants come to China just for gold. Alot of them were their helping ,but they thought they were gonna be able to get gold and leave with it. Intead they just got way less than what a piece of gold cost. That made immigrants leave China and American Republic.In china they were also facing fleeing conflicts and poverty. They also had lots of jobs they didnt entered they all cared about was to get the money.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	0		20131023151027	2363	0		20131023161022	2352	0		20131025091046	2405	1

Many Eurpons&nbsp; left becasue of hunger and that they didn't have many jobs so they came to Aemrican to have jobs,food,and freedom. The Chianesse left because thaey wated a better live and hearing bout the &quot;Gold mountains &quot; they thought that having gold they could pay for land and have a better live stock. Wicth did happen, A nother resaon was they were in war aginst Britten and they also wanted freedom.

That's why some immigrant parents move away from their home countries. During the 1800s, parents immigrated to give their children or families a better, brighter future. Another reason is poverty. They wanted to be able to live and survive, so they moved for jobs.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In some countries family is the only thing that matters because that's all they have. Some immigrants left to escape war and bloodshed. When people from other countries invade, they usually don't care about your beloved; the immigrants wanted to protect their loved ones. Freedom is the gift they wanted to give to the many generations of children to come.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In order to provide for your family, you need money. To receive money you must work hard to earn it. You also need money to escape poverty, which is what many immigrants intended to do for their family.

Then the heard that America was the freedom country so the went to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are these things called &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; and a push is when something happens like you get kicked out of your house. A pull is when you hear of something good and exciting and you want to go and see it. When the Chinese heard about the freedom country they came and moved to get work and food.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was a gold rush in California and when people heard about it and they came from all around the world to find gold.

They came because of pushes and pulls, or things that forced them to come, and things that lured them into coming. The pushes and pulls include harsh conditions and the finding of gold. Lots of immigrants came to the United States for these reasons!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One push reason causing immigrants to come to the United States were caused by of harsh conditions in Europe. Russian Jews left to escape &quot;organized violent attacks.&quot; Italians went through harsh farming losses due to lower prices. Even the tradition of giving the land to the first baby boy was a mistake, since it left younger siblings landless! Hungarians, Greeks, Poles, Portuguese, and Armenians also moved, hoping to make a new life for themselves and their families in the United States. Europeans experience harsh conditions in the 1800s.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pull reason that attracted people was gold. After gold was discovered in 1848 by John Sutter, it attracted huge amounts of immigrants. 70,000 hopeful adventurers came to California in 1849, and 325 of those men were from China. More and more Chinese came as the years went by, hoping to strike rich. Due to this event, by the 1870s, there were almost 65,000 Chinese in the U.S. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that there were only 2,716 in 1851. Gold clearly attracted immigrants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, immigrants settled in the United States by pushes and pulls. The Europeans were forced to by harsh conditions, while the Chinese were attracted by the chance of sudden wealth. People in the United States need to be thankful for these events, for without them, where would we be without them?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023151058	2365	2		20131023151055	2443	2

There were things people wanted to be a part of, and also things they were trying to escape. America was seeming better and better by the day!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people came here to escape from harsh conditions in their home country. For instance, as it says in &quot;Moving to America&quot; by Joy Hakim, &quot;The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed, especially the potato crop.&quot; This was starving the Irish people, so many of them came here for food. But food was not the only problem. From the same article, &quot;Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.&quot; Many of the people moving here were mistreated in their home countries and came for freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other immigrants came here to seek wealth and happiuness. To quote an excerpt from a book on immigrants by Ronald Takaki &quot;Gold Rush! Chinese move to California,&quot; &quot;Like the people who came from the eastern United States, the Chinese hoped to find a fortune waiting for them in the California hills.&quot; Many people looking for money came here to California for the gold rush. Not only the Chinese, but &quot;70,000 hopeful adventurers&quot; settled down in California during this time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still more people just wanted to get a taste of everything going on in America. It helped that &quot;The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster.&quot; (&quot;Changes in America: The 'Pushes' and 'Pulls' for Immigrants&quot;) There was now news about everything great in America travelling at high speed everywhere. &quot;The second half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America.&quot; Who wouldn't want great change?

People from all over the world came to live in The United States of America. Over 1.7 million people from Ireland left their homes to live here. There was about 200,000 more tons of coal produced in 1910 than in 1860. Between the years 1860 and 1910 America grew; a lot.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Between 1860 and 1910&nbsp; travel was easier along with many other things. There were about 8 times as many miles of railroad tracks. This shows that there was a big improvement in the ease of traveling. This is important because if travel didn't get easier the west coast might not be American territory. About 9 times the number of daily newspapers existed. This shows that printing got a lot easier. This is important because, there would probably be less papers today if printing didn't get easier.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The gold rush made America grow, in a big way. The gold rush brought many people to California, &quot;more than 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in CCalifornia in 1849.&quot; This shows that this helped the USA grow. This is important because the US would be a very different place.

This included Russia,Italy,Poland,Demark,Sweden and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those extra people needed food, homes, and jobs-and there just didn't &nbsp;seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Other came for religious freedom. These included people from Holand, and Jews who came from Germany,Poland, and Russia. Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. Still others came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In total some 26 million immigrant arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Think about that 26 million!. Most of the newcomes knew very little absolute America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's whatever they wanted:freedome and a chance to work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were largest immigrant group. Befor the American Civil war in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of a Ireland came &nbsp;to America. That was 1.7 million Irish men, women and children. They kept coming during and after the war. The Irish were desperate because in Ireland crop. There was a food shortage.

There was 26 million immagrants that were fighting in war but then they lost so they had to move to a differnt place and they chose the United States of America they lost alot of people in war and they died. So this is my short story about immagrants.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the chart in then story it says that like how many people live like the population of how many people live in the United States now. Also on that same chart it also says the number of people that lived in each city and they also new the miles of the rail road and the number of daily news papers.Other country's like china and stuff are fighting war still.That is about the chart in this paragraph.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immagrants also got a lot of soldiers and stronger ones from United States so now they have a stronger army for war.Now for war they have over 30 million soldiers for war it is always good to have more then you need so that way you are always ready.Another thing is that they made new and better weapons and they made bombs and everything so they were ready for war.So this is another paragraph about the imagrants.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is what I wrote about the imagrants and what they made and how their wars were.Imagrants needed more people for there next war so they wouldn't have to love California. If they lost California they would have no where to go because the land they lost and the land they have now was there only homeland.So this is my story about imagrants.They need to win in war.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	0		20131023151046	2483	1		20131023151026	2370	0		20131025111038	2405	0

The immagrants from Germany, Poland, and Russia had reloigious freedom when they came to America. The total of immagrants moved to America was 26 million over a 50 year period. The first railroad biult in America was in 1869. This meant people could travel much faster. The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and telephone in 1876 only made news travel faster. The <b>pushes</b> drove people from their homes to poverty. The <b>pulls </b>are those&nbsp; features of life that attract people. The <b>pulls</b> include jobs' wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American Riverin California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. the &quot;Forty-Niners&quot; were 325 men from china. the chinese kept coming year after year. In the middle of 1800's, Guangdong was involved in two wars between Chin and Britan. There were also many rebillions against the government, and endless village and family fueds {fights}. The chinese government raised taxes. The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the beginning. The next year, 450 more chinese arrived in California.

Some because the hardships of war made them leave. Others because farmers couldn't pay taxes and lost all thier land and crops. But most were because of the Gold Rush, the Gold Rush attracted many people to America,14 million people traveled to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First reason people moved to America is because the war made many people from Poland,Italy,Denmark,and even Russia move from thier homes. The reason for this is then Jews weren't allowed,if they were found they would be relocated. So that caused many Jews to be smuggled out of their state or home and head for America. Life with freedom was what those people wanted so they went to work and some achieved and some failed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, people moved to America because there was a food shortage. Crops had failed. Or the farmers did not pay taxes and got everything taken away. Which caused people to leave to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then people moved to America because of the Gold Rush. The Gold Rush made nearly 14 million people came to America for one reason GOLD! People from all over the world came mostly China. The Gold Rush made the population skyrocket. A whole lot of newspaper articles and and visits happened. People came to get rich and lve rich for a long time. The &quot;49ers&quot; kept digging and digging. John Sutter (the owner of the property) tried to keep&nbsp; it a secret but it didn't work out.

I think I know why! People migrated to America to look for jobs, reduce their hunger, and have a better community. During the 1800's there was 31,513,000 people who lived in the U.S. I'm guessing probably half of that are immigrants from other countries. People who have migrated to America had a better life for them and for their families.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first reason why I think people moved to America is because of low food source in their country. They said one fourth of the population in Ireland moved to America. Their reason why is because of hunger! The crops they harvest in Ireland have failed and there was only a little bit of food. It also stated that more than 1 million people died because of HUNGER! Now you know why people moved to America during the 1800's.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An addition to my first reason, people came to America because of decreasing job offers. In the 1800's there was a lot of job offerings! A few of them were working in factories, farming, and to invent things. Many of the immigrants did all of that just to provide their families. Mostly Europeans came to America just to avoid all the hunger they have been through and all their sufferings. All of that came to an end because they migrated to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, people moved to America for a better community. If you were them, would you want to live in a place where danger is? Obviously, I don't, so why would they? All they want to do is keep their families safe from danger. That is why they moved to America! Now do YOU know why people migrated to America during the 1800's?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have stated what I think the reasons are on why people moved to America during the 1800's. Now think, what are the real reasons why they moved? Once again, the immigrants moved to America because they were looking for jobs, reduce their hunger, and have a better community!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023151029	2356	1		20131023151011	2332	2		20131025171003	2483	2

Transportation would be improving day by day. The even started to build a railroad that crossed the United States and was completed in 1869. News traveled by the telegraph made in 1844 and the telephone made in 1876.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848, gold was discovered along the American River in California. It was in the property of a man named John Sutter. Sutter tried to keep it a secret, but the word reached San Francisco and the population started to migrate to the American River. That is when the California gold rush began. In 1849, more than 70,000 people were in California searching for an amazing discovery.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the late 1800s other European's were migrating from their country. These was the Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary people. Between 1750 and 1850 the population of Europe was starting to double. All of those people needed jobs, home, and food. Many of those Europeans came to avoid hunger and fins jobs. Other Europeans came for freedom. Those people were from Holland, and Jews who were from Germany.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all of the technology they have created, there was plenty of things to do. Some either worked in new factories, farmed, built on land, or invented new things. All of the immigrants did that. Before the war in the 1860s, 25% of the whole population of Ireland came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were about 26million immigrants in the United States in a 50 year period! And finally, in 1910 there ended up being 92,407,000 people living in the U.S.!</p>	2		20131023151002	2443	2		20131023151012	2332	2		20131025171042	2405	2

Better lives. People have moved on in search of better lives and they found it here. Some people may be looking for work or others for food. But America is where they came to start over and live better lives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One very important reason why people moved to America was in search for work. And that is what they found! America just found new technology for them to work on. New factories, they could even be farmers, builders or even inventors. Places like Europe needed work and homes and food because their population grew and there wasn't much to do but leave. S they left and found work in America. They came just in time to work on bridges for easier transportation. America was their chance for work and freedom.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Food is important for people too. It fuels us and gives us nutrients! Not many people had food where they lived, sadly. So, they moved to America to find something to fill their bellies. Some places, like Ireland for example, were stuck with soggy crops due to floods. They moved to America to grow food on farms. Luckily, they found the food they needed to live. Poor immagrants hoped to find a better place to live in for themselves, and their families.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One day, a man named John Sutter found gold in 1848 along the American River in California. He kept this as a secret but the word spread that gold was found in California. Soon, The whole country knew and to other countries. Once people knew, they packed up there things and headed for California to find gold and riches. China was one of the countries that found out and they headed for California as soon as they heard. Lots of the Chinese came because they wanted to escape poverty and conflict. The Chinese came in greater numbers to particpate in the Gold Rush. Many of the Chinese could be found throughout the U.S. but 77% of them were in California. The Gold Rush improved the lives of many and changed history greatly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, people from all over the world came to the U.S and just because of gold. They were in search or food, work, homes, and freedom. And that is exactly what they found. America is the ever changing, ever growing country and is perfect for people who want to find better lives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023151057	2363	2		20131025091031	2365	2

Most of the time when they arrived, it was already better. They just had to keep their head up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like people in Ireland, failing crops and starvation were normal to them. Some people wanted to get away form all of that. Almost 1 million people died during this time. So most families left to help them or their children.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something drove people away from their home country and somethings pulled them to America. Russian Jews wanted to get away from attacks, prejudice, and persecution. It all pulled them away from their home. Some people knew there was wealth, land, and better opportunities for them and pulled them to America for the better.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People in China, liked in poverity and hunger filled towns.

One fourth of the group were migrated to America. The Irish migrated over to America because in Ireland their food was rotten,</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the Irish migrated to America because of a food shortage. Their crops were getting destroyed and there was no way to grow them anymore, so because of that many people, even over 1 million, died because there was no food to eat! Others from Ireland and Germany migrated because they were to work in the factories.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese people started migrating to California because they heard about gold! Someone named John Sutter had owned a river filled with gold.He wanted to keep it a secret but the word got out. Someone found out about it and told about it.

In a total of 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over 50 year period.</p>	N		20131024181059	2372		N	20131023151006	2356		N					20131025141055	2356		N

People from the country of Ireland mainly left their country because of the huge amount of Irish people staving. Plus one million people died of starvation in Ireland. They were very low with crops ans that is what caused it. The other people of Eroupe were pushed becuse the needed food and shelter, and they did not have it where they were. This includes the countries of Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. Many imagrants also came because a man in California named John Sutter found gold and many immigrants wanted to strike it rich by finding gold. 325 chinese men also came. This is why they came, but why would they stay? Well in Ireland many people stayed because they simply did not have the money and couldn't leave their homes and just move to America. People didn't come to Califoria because there were already so many people already there and there was a ver very small chance of them finding gold and more than likely they would just waste money coming out to California, unless they were lucky and they found gold. This is a few reason mainly why some people went to America and why some people didn't. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023151050	2370	0		20131023151018	2365	1		20131025091059	2405	1

Some came for gold, some for the new technology, and some came just for a better and easier lifestyle. Many different people from different countries immigrated here. These people include Chinese, Germans,&nbsp; the Irish, Russians, Italians, Polish, and much more! There was a great population increase between 1800 to 1900.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, immigrants came because they needed a better and easier lifestyle. So much of Ireland migrated because their crops had failed. More than 1 million people died because of starvation. Many Europeans came later on because people needed homes and jobs. There wasn't much in Europe at that time. They wanted to avoid hunger and also they needed those jobs which America offered. Others from Holland, and also Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia came because of freedom of religion. Jews were often mistreated because of their beliefs so they came here for freedom and equality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second of all, the technology in the 1800's changed rapidly! Industry also grew. Transportation improved greatly. There was trains now which allowed the migrants to catch the train and move faster and much easier. Information traveled much more quickly now that they created steam power which made it even simpler to create things to receive information by. People started creating newspapers and books. Also, the invention of the telegraph and the telephone made news travel its fastest.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the so many of the Chinese migrated to California because of the Gold Rush. Chinese believed that they would find a fortune immediately! They also moved because of conflicts and poverty. So many people from Guangdong were involved in two was between China and Britain. The Chinese raised taxes which were also trying to got away from.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, in the 1800's the population rapidly changed and America gained many new people and cultures. America had jobs, freedom of religion, food, and gold. What more could people want that were living in despair?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023151045	2352	2		20131023151017	2372	2		20131025091009	2405	3

In the 1800's people started to immigrate to America, because they needed jobs. Some of them immigrated because of religious reasons. Germans made up the largest immigrant group. In my opinion it is sad that the had to come because of religious reasons. The second largest immagrant groups were the Irish.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Irish came to Ireland because of the potato famine. Before the American Civil War, one-fourth of Ireland moved to America. That was 1.7 million people of all ages women and men. More than 1 million people in Ireland died of starvation during the food shortage. They helped build our railroads a little bit along with China immigrants.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese immigrants came because of the California Gold Rush. At first, the person who discovered the gold was going to keep it a secret, but before he knew it San Fransisco knew about it. Then, the east coast, and finally in some other parts of the world. That is called a pull when people are attracted to parts of the world for something.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migrating to other parts of the world is sometimes difficult, especially when it is during something big. We should be thankful that we live in a free country and not somewhere that tries to take control of us. Being able to live somewhere that we do not have a lot of trouble is amazing.

Others try even making it out, that was because during that time it was 1860's, and that meant civil war.Not only it was because it of the war, but on top of that the crops wouldn't grow so no food.

Southern Italians had problems from high birth rates because their lower incomes.Their were some siblings who had a home and others who were homeless.

Many people have a reason why they came here. Maybe they just didn't like&nbsp; the country where thay used to live. Maybe they thought this would be a better place for them and for their kids. Perhaps they thought they could get a really good job, maybe strike it rich. Most people's reason for coming here is the same. Here is why they came here:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People moved to America during the Gold Rush hoping to find money, then go back to their city. But most people liked it here so much that they stayed. Most of the people who came for the Gold Rush came from Guandong. They were hoping to make some money, then go back. But most of them stayed, and that's how America grew even more in population. Another reason people came from Guandong was because they did not have a good job there, and the crops were failing from constant floods.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people moved out of their home country and into america was because of religion. Russian Jews left to escape prejudice and persecution, in the form of pogroms- organized violent attacks. These also included from Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why people have came to America and America has expanded.</p>	2		20131023141051	2363	2		20131023141058	2352	2

Another reason they came to America is to leave their home because there was to much violance where they're from or to find a better place for their families. Some people came because the crops failed to grow at their home and at America the crops were growing really good. Others came for freedom. Some came to mind for gold. Others because there were no jobs or they didn't get payed good so they dediced to come to America. I think some people were acttrated to something in America or thught they would have a better life in America than were they came from.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023141056	2485	1		20131023141023	2352	1

Well, there was a time in history where the United States was a place everyone wanted to go and live. Why? because of how much freedom we have.People that come from one place from another are called immigrants. Some people would come to get&nbsp; a job, or would come because of there &nbsp; religious beliefs, and maybe to even dig for gold.It didn't matter when or where you came from, back then people would come for they wouldn't get judged by color of skin, religious beliefs,or how they looked.They came for freedom and that's what they got.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Germans made up the the largest group of Immigrants, the reason that Germany had so many Immigrants was because of the holocaust, which is when Hitler put all Jews in camps.&nbsp; Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group , because for them the Civil war had started and&nbsp; crops had failed but even after&nbsp; the war and food shortages many Irish people kept coming. In total 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year time period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The gold rush started in 1848 a man named John Sutter discovered it. This is when California mostly got there population,John tried to keep it a secret but didn't by January of 1849 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. Many Chinese people from Guangdong came. Guangdongs population was growing quickly Guangdong could not produce enough rice to feed people. So, that's why most people from china came.&nbsp; First it was only 325 then the following year was 450 then suddenly 2,716 then by 1870 there were 63,000&nbsp; Chinese were in the USA.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	0		20131023141025	2356	0		20131023141038	2370	0

With all the new technology there was plenty for them to do. the could work in factory's, farm and build, or invent things. These people were called immigrants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Germans were the largest immigrant group in 1800s.Irish were the second largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the population of Ireland came to America. the Irish came to America because the Ireland crops had failed. More than one million people died in Ireland because the crops failed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850. All those people needed homes, food, and jobs but there wasn't that in Europe. Many of them came to America to find that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Others came for religious freedom. these included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia.Some other people came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In total, 26 Million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom.

There was 1.7 million men, women, and children who were in Ireland but came to America. Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary did not send many people to America. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid hunger. The second half of the 1800's was a time of great change in America. Tjis was true in Europe also. Travelers now could catch a train that would take them right into a boat. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.</p>	1		20131023141024	2352	1		20131023141049	2356	1

It didn't seem that there was many jobs and homes in Europe. The second half of the 1800 was an awesome change in America because many imigrants were free and got to go to America it took them months to get to America. The number of people born in the United States were 4,096,753 that was alot and most of that people were imigrants yes, it is sad! But the number of people in the U.S were 31,514,000 thats way more people than the people that were born in America. Also the number of people who lived in cities are 6,216,518 and most of those people got tooken away from there house. Will thats all i got to say about imigrants.

Here are some of the reasons. People moved to America to get reasons. They also moved to get food. People moved a lot to get jobs. They moved to get freedom and land too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason people moved to get resources was because they didn't have all the resources we do here in America. Everybody needs reasons like trees to build homes to live in. We also need plants so we have something to eat. Resources are also used to have books to read so we can be smarter.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People moved to America to get jobs. They might not of had jobs where they lived. Maybe they did have jobs but they didn't get much money. Most people like the jobs we have here because you get payed more. We are not forced to work all the time like they are over seas and when they do that they die because they have to work so much.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People move to get food. You might wonder why they move to get food. People move to get food because they do not have much food. Sometimes its because they are starved where they live now.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People move to get land and freedom because they do not have that every where. Some people don't like to live with a lot of people around them. Some people like to live in the city where you alway have some one around. If you live in the country you have a lot of freedom, but if you live in the city you don't have every much freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023141034	2370	1		20131023151020	2485	1

The Europeans built a boat to migrate to America. The Europeans wanted to migrate to America because they knew they would have a better life. Also, some of the Europeans came for freedom, religious freedom, foods and crops. Germans made up the largest single immigrant group in the 1800s. Next to the Germans, the Irish were the largest immigrant group. Before the American Civil War in the 1860s, one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. (That was 1.7 million Irish men, woman, and children.) they kept coming, during and after the war. The Irish were so desperate because in Ireland, crops had failed, especially the potato crop. There was a food shortage. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800s, people started coming from other European countries that had not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe doubled between 1750 and 1850.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, there was great a change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. People could travel on these trains too. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advances in transportation made it possible for more people to travel more easily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of&nbsp; a man named John Sutter. Although Sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundered of people left the city to set off for the American River. The news spread to the&nbsp; rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world as well.&nbsp; By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousand of overland travelers were head for California. The California gold rush had begun. More than 70,000 hopeful adventures arrived in California in1849. Among these &quot;Forty-Niners&quot; were 325 men from China. More Chinese cam ethe next year, and the next.

Many immigrants moved to America to start a new life because of something bad. Germans, Jews, Irish, and Chinese immigrants arrived America in the late 1800s'<br> to start a brand new and better life in this country.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason why these immigrants came to America is to start a better life because of bad economy, hunger, and poverty in their home country. The second reason why the immigrants came to America is because they were mistreated. The Jews came to America because in Germany, they were tortured because of their beliefs. Finally the third reason they came to America is because they were looking for gold in California during the time of the Gold Rush. The Chinese came to America because China had a war with Britain and became very poor. Then they heard stories of mountains of gold being found in California, so they moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I learned that immigrants that came from different countries because of different, but sad reasons.

New technology would just be waiting to be used! Lots of attractions, also known as ''pulls'' would bring in many immigrants. Since information and news were quick to travel around the world, people were more aware of America. As a result, America attracted many visitors, immigrants, and especially increased population and industrial growth by a lot!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though America was supported by its pulls, it was also supported by ''push.'' Others came to the country for religious freedom, people like Jews. Religious people were often mistreated for their own home countries. Even some came to escape wars, which put their lives in danger at home.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, time in the 1800s was a great success for the USA. Many got their footsteps on America. Technology improved, especially transportation: the first railroad was completed. Resources were meant to be easier to move. Advances like boats and steamships made travel much more easier and faster! News and information traveled very soon around the globe, resulting to be more aware of the world around them.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One great period of time led the population uprising! This decade was known as the Gold Rush. Gold was discovered and word spread quick. The most hopeful wave of immigrants were the Chinese. These people hoped to find a great fortune waiting for them in California. The Chinese also moved not only because of the gold, but they were in poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these successes led to the growth of the population, especially the industrial growth. The population went uprising! Population went high than never before. Thanks to all the spread, it led America to a good future in 1910.</p>	1		20131023141047	2372	1		20131023141013	2367	2		20131025111029	2405	1

New transportation has been mad to make it more convenient for traveling. Now it is much easier for people to move to America. They could take a train to another method of transportation to get to America. The printing press was also invented at that time to print inexpensive books and newspapers, so that opened up a job opportunity for someone that is looking for a job.

These country's/ states are Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. many of the people that came to America came because of need of work, and to avoid hunger. A great deal others came to find religious freedom. All these factors can be put into two different categories, Pushes and Pulls.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pushes are those features in life that drive people from their homes&quot;. These include a harsh environment, wars and other conflicts, and poverty&quot;. Those two sentences were copied from the http://worldhistoryforusall.sdsu.edu and http://www.learner.org/. websites. &quot;Pulls are those features in life that attract people.&quot; and &quot;These include jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms&quot;. Those two quotes were from the same websites.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When people first came to America some came for religious freedom, as I said earlier. Those people that came originated from Holland, (and the people of Jewish religion originated from Germany), Poland, and Russia. The Jewish people immigrated mostly because of the way they were treated back home (poorly). The people of Ireland came as well because of all of there crops dieing back home. By the 1860's, one-fourth of the entire population of Ireland had came to America. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

They mainly kept their eye on California, where they hoped to get rich after the Gold Rush started in 1849. As it says in the article <b>Gold Rush! Chinese Move to California</b>, the Chinese called California <b>Gam Saan</b>, or &quot;Gold Mountain.&quot; They heard about all the gold that was found there, and they craved to go to &quot;Gold Mountain&quot;, find a fortune, and return to China with their riches. According to the same source, 77% of the 63,000 Chinese&nbsp; who lived in America in 1780 were living in California.</p> <p>Some other reasons why the Chinese came to America could be to escape the oppressive government and the extensive village and family fights. In the mid-1800's, Guangdong was also involved in two wars between Britain and China.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The industry grew and transportation was improved in America in the second half of the 1800's. The first railroad to cross the United States was completed in 1869, and that meant resources such as silver and lumber could become more widely available. The redesigning of the printing press, steam power, the telegraph, and the telephone also helped information travel more quickly and widely. These things attracted immigrants too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you can see, many people from China and Europe emigrated from their own countries and went to America for with their own reasons; from seeking religious freedom to finding gold. The number of&nbsp; people born outside the United States who were living there went from just over four million to over thirteen million from 1860 to 1910, just a fifty year period! America was the target for many people seeking a new start in the 1800's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>	2		20131024101002	2363	2		20131024101039	2352	2

Some people wasn't even given that much food, because of their skin color, or because their planting went wrong.</p> <p>&nbsp; Around the 1800s Irish people were desperate for food, that is because their crops have failed, they didn't grow or anything.</p> <p>More than 1 million people died by starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp; European countries had little things for people. Like food, they didn't have enough for everyone to get a whole meal. They couldn't get a home so fast, they had to do many certain things to be able to have a house. And jobs, not everyone had jobs. Kids didn't go to school or anything.</p> <p>&nbsp; Some people didn't get to choose their religion because of they're skin color, or because the government didn't approve that. If they decided to choose their own religion, they would get beaten or killed.</p> <p>&nbsp;Over a 50 year period, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States. The newcomers only knew a little bit about America. But they knew it was a land of freedom because that's why they wanted to go there.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1869, the United States finished their first railroad, so it was much easier for them to move resources, like silver and lumber.</p> <p>It was also must easier for the people to travel, because they can go in trains. It was easy for the people to go to one place to another.</p> <p>&nbsp;It was also easy for Europeans to travel because there was a train that will take them right to a boat.</p> <p>&nbsp;In 1844 the telegraph was invented, and in 1876 the telephone only made the news travel faster.</p> <p>It was much easier for the people now, they had the ability to move long distances. These were often called &quot;<b>pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot;</b>.<i> &quot;<b><u>pushes are those features of life that drive people from their homes</u>&quot;</b> </i>Like the harsh environment, war and other problems like that. They pushed their self to accomplish those things, even if it causes death.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&quot;</b><b><u>Pulls are those features of life that attract people.&quot; </u></b>Which is talking about jobs, wealth, access to resources, and of course perceived freedoms. People often pulled them self in doing those things because they didn't like how they been treated. They didn't like how they get beaten to death if they didn't do what their ruler said, or how they would die because they didn't get much food.</p> <p>&nbsp;Most people in the European countries mostly wanted to escape, because a lot of people were suffering and they didn't like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Italians suffered by high birth rates, and farming loses. <b><u>&quot;The tradition of leaving family land to the first-born male often left younger siblings landless.&quot;</u></b> The immigrants hoped to make a new life and have a family in the United states so they traveled to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>&quot;Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter.&quot; </u></b>John tried hiding the discovery a secret but the word went around fast.

That's when the gold rush had begun.</p> <p>&nbsp;For China, if the people couldn't pay their taxes the Chinese government will raise their taxes. For the people that wouldn't be able to pay their taxes, the people would have to sell their land. The area couldn't even produce enough rice to feed the people. Especially because floods often happened, and their crops got over flooded and failed.</p> <p>&nbsp;The news about the Gold Mountain was spread around China and many people wanted to join to become rich.</p> <p>&nbsp;In 1849, 325 Chinese joined the gold rush. After a year 450 more Chinese people arrived in California.</p> <p>&nbsp; 1851-2,716 people, 1852-20,026 people, and in 1870 there was 63,000 Chinese in the United States. 77% of them was in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Population</p> <p>Number of people in the U.S.A.- By 1860 the population was 31,513,000.

Another reason was because in the 1848 people started to discover about gold. I think that's why most people went there. The person that discovered the gold was a man named John Sutter. He found the gold along the American River. Many many people went there but because the eastern united states people went a lot of the Chinese people went and hoped to find fortune. Many Chinese men went over there because the wanted to join the forty niners. Chinese people migrated because the government raised taxes and many people couldn't afford it so they had to give up many things that they owned and loved. It was really hard for everybody because it was really hard to grow crops because the floods that they had would often destroy them. It was even harder because their population was growing and growing and they really couldn't control it. People didn't really know what to do so when they heard about the gold rush that's when a lot of them came and some became part of the forty niners. and that's some reasons why people moved here instead of staying were they came from. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	1		20131024101056	2485	1		20131024101033	2363	1

I cant say all at once because that would be really confusing! So one at a time will have to do . Lets start with the Irish and why they moved okay its really factional.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1800s the working people moved to America because their homelands were either being ruined, rundown, poor, or just because they wanted to . Well the Irish was one of the largest immigration groups that was back before the war of course. More than one-fourth of Ireland's people moved to America!!!The reason they moved was because their crops had failed ,mainly their potatoes --gasp--!! More than 1 million people died of starvation ( that's not good)!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So later in the 1800s some of the Germans moved because of their rights to have their own religion ( let them be FREE!!! ). Also a lot of people moved to escape the wars that made life UNPREDICTABLE, DUN DUN DUUNN!!! Sooo in total 26 MILLION!!</p> <p>immigrants moved over a 50 YEAR PERIOD ( say whaa!!!). Most people knew that it was &quot; The Land of the Free&quot; (and the-e home of the-aa braaave)</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As America changed (as in changed i mean the transportation grew larger mmkay).</p> <p>many many many immigrants arrived to share with us the place we call home!!! witch was also true in EUROPE ( ooh-ya). Travelers can now take a train to a boat ( witch takes them to America by the way mmkkaayy). It would have taken months but new STEAMSHIPS!! make the trip as easy as pie . Also the way of getting information change quickly . The redesigning of the printing press made it totally easy to make like cool newspappers and magazine articles plus the making of books made it an easy way to make a little bit of pocket money for the little ones so they can become BIG STARS. As people became more aware to the world around them they became really really happy that they decided to move to America .</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So lets talk about gold mmkay yeah that will be fun!!! Well gold was discovered in the mid 1800s in guess where AMERICA yay!! A man named John Sutter discovered it one day and the news spread all over ( this is the beginning of the California gold rush!!) Now this is the part where the Chinese come in yay!</p> <p>So the Chinese immigrated&nbsp; because they were really poor and homes were being demolished . Farmers had to sell there land to pay taxes witch left then no were to plant food and no plants to sell to make money . So we got some poor hungry farmers that dont know what to do , here comes the good news. Wait for it Wait for it EVERYBODY HEARD ABOUT THE GOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND IMMIGRATED TO FING GOLD AND BECONE RICH!!!!! In the end there was a few problems but not big enough that you would have to go to war ( or did they DUN DUN DUUUNN)</p>	0		20131025161029	2367	0		20131024101010	2372	0

They went through a hard jorney to get here and changed our country alot. They brought lots of new inventions here and invented lots of things here. It is a great day to praise the immigrents that came here and changes they made.</p> <p>&nbsp; In the 1800s, Germans came to America and were the largest single group to come. The Irish were next and one-fourth of them came to America and that was 1.7 million people. The crops in Ireland were failing and they had to come or else they would starve. They were the people that came because their homeland were having a bad time, but others came for religious freedom. The people included Jews and people in Holland. About 26 million immigrants arrived in USA over a 50 year period. Most of the people either wanted freedom or a chance to work.</p> <p>&nbsp; In that period when the people were arriving, industry grew, transportation improved and the first railroad to cross US was completed in 1869. They could move resources easier and shorter for many people. This improved also in Europe and people could more easily travel from Europe to USA. The telegraph and telephone made news travel fast and faster. It became easier to travel long distances and they moved faster than ever. More people traveled to the United States from around the globe.</p> <p>&nbsp; While all this was happening, another thing attracted people,the Gold Rush! People traveled all the way from China to come. n 1849, 70,000 hopeful adventurers looking to strike some gold arrived. The 325 Chinese people were just the beginning, the next year, 450 more Chinese arrived looking for gold. Then a whole bunch more came and by 1870, there were 63,000 Chinses in the US.</p> <p>&nbsp; In 50 years about 60 million people came, 10 million born outside of the US. They prouduced huge amounts of coal for the 400 million more train track for the trains. And much more newspapers were prouduced. All in all a superb amount of people flourised in the US.</p>	2		20131024091051	2372	2		20131024091025	2368	2		20131025161023	2443	2

For example, according to the text, there were plenty of things to do in America. Like, people who came to America could've worked in factories, invented new things, and farmed or built on the land. So, there were many things to do in America that brought lots of immigrants to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s. Next to them were the Irish. The Text directly states that, 1.7 million Irish men, woman, children came to America. That is one-fourth of the whole population of Ireland! During the Civil War, many people kept coming, during and after the war. For example, according to the text, the Irish were very desperate. A reason for this is because in Ireland many crops had failed, especially the potato crop. Also there was food shortage. A huge amount of people died in Ireland (over 1 million people) because of starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, later in the 1800s, people started coming from European countries. Many people in Europe needed food, homes, and jobs. And there wasn't enough of those things in Europe. These people included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. So, many people from Europe came to the America to find work and to avoid hunger.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many others came for religious freedom. This included people from Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland, and Russia. The Jews were often mistreated in their home countries so they came to America. Also, others came to escape wars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; In conclusion, 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Many people arrived here because America was a land of freedom. Also, others came here for a chance to work and get money. So, many immigrants came to America for freedom, a chance to work, and get money.</p>	2		20131024091039	2363	2		20131024091046	2368	2

They didnt now anyone or anything. Then when they say the staue of liberty they knew they were in america. They thought that was a good sign it was. When they arrived in new york city they had to go to a island called Ellis island. They would get checked up on, see how much money they had and ect. When they passed they were enterd in america. I know they felt happy. They finally made it to america, but not all the time its not good. If the baby is not healthy or somethings wrong with it they will send it back from were it came from. They did start in the 1800's with all this. So there was about 1.7 million irish men,women,and children go to america. Thats alot! One reason they left was because the food was shortage,1 million people died from starvation in ireland. In the 1800's there were people who came to eropean countries before they came to america. Which was Russia,Italy,Poland,Denmark,Sweden,and Hungary. All thoses people needed food,water,and a house to live in. Others would come for religious freedom. They had 26 million who came to the United States. Thats alot! Then they wanted freedom and a chance to work. Then there came chinese people who came to america. They came because they herd there was gold in the rivers. It was called the gold rush. There were 325 chinese who came ans joined the gold rush. The next year 450 came and joined the gold rush. Then&nbsp; there was 2,716. WOW! That became alot if you can tell.

Others came for religious freedom. These included people from Holland, and Russia.More then 70,000 hopeful adventurers arrived in California in 1849.In the middle of the 1800s, Guangzhou was involved in two wars between china and Britain. Most of this first wave of Chinese migrants came from Guangzhou, an area on china's south coast. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They were fleeing from conflicts and property.

Then suddenly they came in greater numbers: 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. The exciting news adout Gold Mountain spread throughout china. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. Germans made up the largest single group of immigrants in the 1800s.In total, some 26 million immigrants arri ved in the United states over a 50 year period.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	N		20131025091015	2368		N	20131024091049	2443		N					20131025151006	2443		N

For example jobs, opportunities, wealth, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. &quot;Push&quot; is people that drive from there home for features of life too. MAny of new Europeans wanted to escape the harsh conditions. Even Russian Jews escaped because of prejudice and persecution. Thats why the Europeans moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese moved to America because of te gold rush. 63,000 Chinese moved to California by 1870. to Chinese California seemed to be a land of richness.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have moved to America and California, total during a 50 time year period some 26 million people moved. when the people moved to America they didnt really know anything about it, all they knew was that it was a land of freedom. It didnt really matter to them because the people just wanted freedom and to have a job to make money for their children.

Some of these people included: German's, Irish, Russian's,Italians, Pole's, Denmark's, Swedish, Hungarian, Jews, Holland, Greek's,&nbsp; Portuguese, Armenians, and Chinese. There were &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot; to come to America.As you can tell, America was a growing country!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germans then Irish were the 2 largest immigrant groups. They were coming because of war,failing crops,food shortages,and starvation.America had plenty of good soil for these people because most of it hadn't been used yet. They couldn't starve and die with all of the food being grown.Later in the 1800's, European countries were sending people that hadn't before. All of these people coming needed: jobs, food, and shelter. There was lots of undeveloped land that could be used to put up shops and even makes houses.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other immigrants were coming to find religious freedom. Mainly Jews, because they were mistreated for their religious beliefs in their countries. Life that was unstable made many others move to America.About 26 million people came to America in near 50 years!Many saw America as a land of freedom and opportunity.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold Rush! Gold Rush! Read all about it! In 1848 John Sutter discovered gold on his home estate in California. Since he found all of this gold, news spread around. Many Chinese moved to California searching for gold. Most of the Chinese came from Guangdong, trying to get away from poverty and war conflicts. And even many rebellions against the government, and raised taxes.Once they struck gold, and collected it, they went back home.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were multiple reasons people moved to America. Like, searching for gold, religious freedom, food, shelter,etc. America made hopes and dreams for many people, but not everyone got what they wanted.By 1970 ,63,000 Chinese moved to the us, so imagine how many total people moved to America-that's a lot! From 1860-1910, 60,874,000&nbsp; people moved to America!

Here's why certain groups of immigrants moved to America.</p> <p>Around 1860 in Ireland, a lot of crops didn't grow, resulting in</p> <p>food shortage. Irish people came to America because of this and after that kept coming. Later on in the 1800's, people from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary came to the U.S. because of need of food, houses, and jobs that there wasn't enough of in Europe. The people who didn't come for jobs, homes, or foods, came for religious reasons or to escape horrible wars.</p> <p>A lot of Europeans wanted to get away from harsh conditions</p> <p>in Europe so they came to America. Russian Jews escaped in pogroms from prejudice and persecution. Italians in the south had high birth rates and farming loss because of lower prices, which caused them to start their lifes over in the U.S.</p> <p>In 1849, tons of Chinese people came to the U.S. to find gold</p> <p>that had been found a year earlier. But some Chinese came because of problems with wars and poverty. People rebelled against the government. There was endless village and family fighting. Their government raised taxes, which caused farmers not able to pay them have to sell land. During all of this in Guangdong, China, the population was growing rapidly and the area couldn't grow enough food to give the people since the crops were getting flooded.</p> <p>Of course all of this immigration caused the population to</p> <p>increase. In 1860 the population was 31,513,000. By 1910 the population had almost tripled to 92,407,000. But the population wasn't the only thing to increase. The number of people who lived in cities in 1860 was more than 6 million and by 1910 was almost 42 million! The number of people born outside of the U.S. in 1860 was a little over 4 million and was up to 13 million in 1910. The coal collected in 1860 was almost 20.5 million tons. In 1910 more than 417 million tons was collected. That's more than 6 times the amount collected in 1860!! The miles of railroad track in 1860 was 30,626 and 240,293 in 1910. The number of daily newspapers in 1860 was 387 and was up to 2,600 in 1910. All of these things increased a lot in 50 years- and a lot of it was because of immigrates!<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024091007	2352	1		20131024091028	2364	2		20131024171006	2405	2

In other country's like Germany, and China people felt &quot;pulls and pushes&quot; A pull is something that makes you want to leave your old home behind such as wealth, and searching for religious freedom. A push is something that makes you leave your home, an example would be wars, wars played a big role on people leaving their homes, towns, and country's.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A couple examples of pulls would be in 1849 the California Gold Rush was discovered and immigrants from china rushed over to America in search to find wealth, and jobs working in the rush. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California on a mans property, named John Sutter. John tried to keep the gold a secret, eventually the word that gold was found in his property reached San Fransisco like China hundreds of people set off to the American River in search for wealth. By January 1849 60 ships, and thousands of overland travlers were headed for California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 1800's America had produced lots of new technology and made it very easy for immigrants to come in to America. Many people left just in search for a new beginning in many things such as religious freedom, wealth, and to get our of the wars that could be occuring in their countrys now.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When the new immigrants came in to America there was plenty for them to do like work in the newly built factorys, farm on the lands (plant crops), build on the lands, and also invent things, immigrants did all these things. Many Germans came to America due to the Civil War occuring in Germany.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the graph i noticed that from the 1800's to the 1900's the numbers overall went up. The number for how many people in the US went from 31,513,000 to 92,407,000.

The second largest group is the Irish, one/fourth of the whole population came to get away from war. That's 1.7 million Irish men,women,and children. They kept coming, during and after the war. In he later 1800s people from Europe started immigrating to the U.S. People from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary also came to the U.S. around this time.

Americas industry grew and many more immigrants arrived on America's shores. One of the first railroads that crossed the united states was completed in the 1869. This made it easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to East. Having this railroad also made it easier for people to travel to far distances and make the tip shorter. If you want to take a train right to a boat you can and the trip wouldn't be as long as it would have been without the railroad.

Now with a steam power and the redesign of the printing press made it possible to print many inexpensive books and newspapers. This made news and ideas available to more people. The telegraph invention in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 made news travel faster. With the ability to move long distances fast and easily, people moved more than ever before. The reason why they are moving more than ever is because of&nbsp; &quot;pushes&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot;.&nbsp; Pushes are those ways of life that kick people out of their homes. those reasons include harsh environments, wars, and many other conflicts, and poverty. Pulls are the features of life that attract people, such as, jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024091036	2368	2		20131024091017	2367	2

The Chinese were in poverty and wanted to strike it rich. For example, in the text it said farmers who were unable to pay their taxes had to sell their land. Many people wanted to join the gold rush. The Chinese also left to flee from conflicts. For example, in the text it says they were fleeing from conflicts and poverty.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason is for religios reasons. The Jews moved for getting made fun of. For example, in the text it says Jews were often mistreated for their beliefs in their home countries. People from Holland moved for being greatly mistreated also. For example, in the text it says others came for religious freedom. People from Holland came to America for that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, immigrants from all over the world came to America. One reason was the gold rush.

People moved to America in the 1800's because of the the lack of jobs, food ; the avoidance of hunger and the Chinese mainly to find gold. America back then was well known for a fair country, the citizens in America got treated with more respect than for example in Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Russia and Poland, the Jews from their countries were not treated fairly for their beliefs. People in America didn't pay much attention to the Jew's religion as for in their country it was a &quot;bad&quot; thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first reason why immigrants traveled to America was the very little jobs in other countries. The people who immigrated to America would leave others behind with no working jobs nor a big population. People who were good at working mainly moved to America. without many people in some countries the jobs were no longer in service and everything started to fail little by little.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more devistating reason was the lack of food provided in the countries. For example Southern Italians moved beacuse of faarming losses. When people farmed they provided food, but without them nothing was produced. There was also a food shortage in Ireland which killed millions of people. The immigration was not a very good thing to the people left behind in their countries. Everybody needs food to survive, most European people left and came to America to avoid starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1848 gold was discovered by a man named John Sutter. The word of finding gold spread quickly, before you knew it hundreds of people traveled to California to find gold.

Immigrants came to America for many reasons. Some were &quot;pushed&quot; to America by conflicts and harsh enviroment; while others were &quot;pulled&quot; to America by the religious freedom and many&nbsp; jobs. I would like to explain how these immigrants came to America and their stories.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine this: you are a German child living in a world with harsh weather, no religious freedom, and tons of conflict. Your family cannot take your country anymore and decides to leave Germany for America. In this situation you are being &quot;pushed&quot; to America. Irish immigrants were &quot;pushed&quot; from their country due to crops failing and a shortage of food. After that, many other Europeans left to go to America so they didn't die of starvation. Other immigrants also left for religious freedom because America was known as the land of freedom. Some immigrants left their home countries to escape the war and find jobs. Over fiftey years 26 million immigrants were in the US. A majority of the immigrants were &quot;pushed&quot; to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine this: you are living in China, when word comes to you that in America there is riches beyond your belief. You pack your stuff and buy the next ticket to America, the land of freedom. In this case, you are being &quot;pulled&quot; to America. Many immigrants left for America because of all the oppourtunities to become famous and rich. At this time, most of the inventors were immigrants. Famous scientist, Albert Einstien was an immigrant from Germany searching for a job. Many of the Chinese sailed to America because of the gold rush in California. Other immigrants left for jobs to support their family. Lots of immigrants were &quot;pulled&quot; by America's jobs and riches.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this passage you will be able to understand why immigrants came to America and their stories. When immigrants came the population flourished and the amount of production blasted up. Before immigration, not a lot of people were born outside of America, but after immigration a majority of the population was born outside of the US. I think immigration truley made a majoe impact on the united states.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024081000	2372	2		20131024091047	2363	2

Now lets go back in time to when many new things were happening such as the Gold Rush and the industrial revolution. during the 1800s many immigrants traveled to America ship after ship. the many reasons they might have come here may have been because of the profound freedom they may have here from high taxes or because of their specific religious belief, or maybe it was because of the double in population, hunger, harsh environment,wars or other conflicts. These are known as ''pushes'' beacuse these things happening&nbsp; their homeland pushed them to find a new home. There are also things called &quot;pulls&quot;. ''Pulls&quot; may include jobs,wealth,opportunities,access to resources, and freedom. these are called pulls beacuase it made the immigrants get pulled into America.Now we fast forward in time to the Gold Rush. in 1849 a man named John Sutter found gold along the American River on his property.despite his intentions of keeping his discover a secret word soon reached San Fransisco. By january 1849 many people were sailing and taking wagons from all over the world to get their hands on some of ''Sutter's gold'', however many of them were unlucky and went home even more broke than before. In this time though, more than 70,000 miners and their families arrived in america increasing the population quite a bit.in conclusion, almost everything in America doubled,if not tripled, between the years of 1860 and 1910 ,and still today many of the proud Americans still live here because of their immigrant ancestors and their brave decissions.</p>	1		20131024081022	2367	1		20131024081022	2363	1		20131024171043	2405	2

Over 26 million immigrants came to the United states&nbsp; in over 50 years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next some immigrants migrated because of the &quot;Push and Pull,&quot; and the improved transportation. Some other people left because of wars. Some people left because of wealth or jobs. Other people left to America because of the floods. People also laft because of the Gold Rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, people left because of he miles of railroad tracks.

All the people needed food, homes, and jobs so they came over here to find homes, jobs, and tried to avoid hunge. Other people came here just to have religious freedom. this included people from Holland, and Jews who came from Germany, Poland, and Russia. (Jew people were often mistreated for their belief in their homes countries.) still other peaople came to escape wars that made life unstable and unpredictable. In total 26 million immigrants arrived in United states over 50 year perode. think about those 26 million!. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America exept that it was a land of freedome. Thats wat all the people wanted freedom and to work and make some money. The secound half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores transporting improved. The first railroad that croSsed the United states was complete in 1869.

The question is, why did they move from Europe to America. There are several reasons why. Most of the immigrants were German and the other was Irish. The Irish moved here because the crops there were failing. We called this The Potato Famine. Their people were dying from starvation. The Germans moved here because they could not find any jobs. In America, they became entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur is a person who starts their own business.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another big immigration was China. China moved here because they also couldn't find jobs. During the 1850's, they started on a railroad track. The track extended from the eastern part of America to the western part of America. The Chinese were a big help with it. The railroad track took 15 years to complete.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last big migration of immigrants were the Jews. The Jews were treated harshly for what they believed in. Russian Jews were worked to death and they starved to death.Even the Jews in America were treated harshly. Most of Americas population today are mostly Jews but they don't get treated badly like back then. During WWII, Adolf Hitler prisoned the Jews and put them in concentration camps. Very few survived. Hitler believed in people with blue eyes and blond hair. He hated the Jews because they did not have blue eyes. They would stick needles in their eyes to change the color of them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024081003	2485	2		20131024081030	2367	2

They moved to California because of the Gold Rush! Back in 1848, along the American River in California John Sutter had discovered Gold!&nbsp; Even though he tried keeping it a secret, the word about the find had soon reached San Francisco. After the exciting news hundreds and hundreds of people had set out to the American River. By then, the word had gotten around the U.S. and to other parts of the world. Around January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of travelers were headed straight for California. That's when the Gold Rush had begun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 70,000+ adventuerous travelers full of hope finnaly arrived in CA in 1849. WOW it took one whole year to get to CA! Among &quot;Gold MIners&quot; were 325 men from China. Next came another year and more Chinese came and then the next year came and more and more Chinese came.Like people who came from Eastern U.S., the Chinese hoped to find great fortune waiting for them in the CA hills.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hopelessly, people listened to tales of gold beyond the Pacific Ocean. People had called CA &quot;Gold Mountain&quot; because to them it seemed like a land of unbelivable wealthiness. They said they would go, make their fortunes, and return back to China. Throughout China news spread about Gold Mountain and many people wanted to join. Thats why people moved to CA because of the Gold Rush. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024081035	2352	2		20131024081020	2367	2

The Germans made the largest group of the immigrants, but the Irish were the largest immigrants of the group and there were1.7 million Irish in America mens, womens, and childrens. When the Civil War started in the 1860's, the Irish were desperate because their crops died and especially the potato crops. More than 1 millon people died of starvation in Ireland.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the 1800's, people started to come from other countries that had not sent many people to America before. It included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The populations increase between 1750 and 1850. All of the extra&nbsp; people needed homes, jobs, and food. They were all hunger, but they were trying to avoid the food and try something else.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the second half of the 1800's, it was changing in America. Industryal immigrants arrived on the America's shores and was transported to their city. In the United States, they made railroad tracks that cross all around the world. It was more easy than walking and starving in the hot or cold weather, but now they have railroad tracks to relax and eat along the way to travel to somewhere else.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When there was citys and buildings, it was rapidly changing and going fast because there was steam power everywhere. People came more aware of the world around them because it was more easy for them to travel instead of walking all day long. In this environment, there was going to be wars and other conflicts that other people are trying to access jobs and freedoms.</p>	1		20131024081026	2367	2		20131024081001	2363	1		20131024181058	2405	1

One of the reasons was, there was the California Gold Rush. Many people from China decided to immigrate to America for gold.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people moved to America is, transportation improved. The first railroad in the United States was completed in 1869. This made it easier to transport resources such as, silver. These trains and other new transportation made it easier for people to transport things and to travel easier.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new print press design made more print books and newspapers less expensive. This made people more aware of news and ideas in the United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason people immigrated to the United States in the 1800s is, there was much more new technology, factories, farms, and to invent things such as, the telephone. Some people immigrated to the United States because they were trying to avoid leading to starvation.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people even came to the United States for religious freedom. America was known as the land of freedom. They came because what they wanted was, freedom and work. They needed a chance to work. They also came to America for coal production.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people came to America because their crops failed and there was a food shortage. Some people came for homes. Some people came to America to escape wars that led them to an unstable life.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of people came for wealth, and opportunities. They would have better access to resources and harsh conditions. They also came so they wouldn't have violent attacks. They all came for a new life for family and themselves in America in some way.</p>	1		20131024081046	2367	2		20131024081002	2352	1		20131025101009	2405	1

I decided to do a essay explaining why immagrants moved to America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To begin with, One reason that immagrants moved to America maybe was because of war. People started coming from Europian countries like Russia, Italy and more. It was hard because they had to have a home and food and Jobs and there wasn't enough of them in Europe. Many Europians came for work so they coukd get money fot food. So they could avoid hunger. Some came from religious freedom. People from Holland, Jews from Germany, Poland and more. They came to escape wars that were hard to live through.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, twenty six million immagrants moved to the United states. Those people knew very little about America. Except the fact that it was the land of freedom. They wanted freedom and the chance to work and earn money. The second half of the Eight teen hundreds was great. Industry grew and immagrants moved more and more into America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, Now there had been more immagrants it would be easier to move silver and lumber from east to west. The trips became shorter and easier. Travelers could now catch a train that would take them to a boat. A trip to America would have taken so much longer in earlier times. But new steamships make the trip faste. The advances in transportation made it easier for people to travel quicker. People became more intersted in the world around them with the ability to travel distances.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, The eighteen hundred changed a lot from the first half to the second half. The first half they didn't have as many people and were just getting immagrants. The second have of the eighteen hundreds had increased im people. They had gotten over twenty six million immagrants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131024081000	2443	1		20131024081002	2363	1		20131024181014	2405	3

There is a reason for every thing that you will ever do. During the 1800s, many immagrants that could invent or people who could biuld great farm for money would come to America. Those people were mostly needed for the new factories, and to invent new things.Immagrants did all of that&nbsp; very very hard work.They also came over because of push and pull factories. like when the gold rush happend. Now you know why immagrants came to america.</p>	0		20131024081040	2363	0		20131024081052	2352	1		20131025101055	2405	0

With all the new <b>technology </b>in the 1800s there was plenty for them to do. They were needed to work in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. In the later 1800s, people started comeing from other European countries that not sent many people to America before. This included Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. the population of Europe doubled between 1750. All those extra people needded food, homes, and job-and there just didn't seem to be enough of them in Europe. Many Europeans came to America to find work and to avoid <b>hunger.</b> In total, some 26 million immigrants arrived in the United States over a 50 year period. Think about that-26 million!. Most of the newcomers knew very little about America except that it was a land of freedom. But that's what they wanted: freedom and a chance to work. The seconed half of the 1800s was a time of great change in America. Industry grew and many immigrants arrived on America's shores. Transportation improved. The first railroad that crossed the United States was completed in 1869. This meant that it became easier and easier to move resources like silver and lumber from the West to the East. People could travle on these trains too. A trip from one place to another became shorter and easier for many people. This was true in Europe also. Travelers now could catch a train that would take them right to a boat. A trip to America in earlier times would have taken months, but new steamships could make the trip much faster. These advances in transportation made it possible for more people to travle more easily. Gold was discovered in 1848 along the American River in California, on the property of a man named John Sutter. Although sutter tried to keep the discovery a secret, word of the find soon reached San Francisco, and hundred of people left the city to set off for the American River. The news spread to the rest of the United States, and to other parts of the world as well. By January of 1849, 60 ships and thousands of overland travelers were headed for California. The California&nbsp; <b>gold rush, had begon.&nbsp;</b> The 325 Chinese who joined the gold rush in 1849 were just the biginning. The next year, 450 more Chinese arrived in California. Then suddenly they came in greater numbers: 2,716 in 1851, and 20,026 in 1852. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the United States, and they had played a critical part in building the first <b>transcontinental </b>the country,<b>77%</b> of them were in California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	N		20131023171009	2352		N	20131023171016	2368		N					20131025161058	2352		N

I will include why they came and what they had to go threw to come here. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, I'll describe why the immagrants came to America. They first came to America because they needed a job. Luckily the 1800s were a time of technology and the could of worked in the new factories, farming and building on lands, and inventing things. They needed money to feed their families. They also came because the needed food to feed their families and themselves. Some even came in seek of freedom from&nbsp;their country and religiously. After industries grew more people came in search of work. When they came it was great because a new way of transportation was invented, the railroad, subway, or train. This was great because it was a faster way of transportation than walking. The main reasons they came were jobs, wealth, opportunities, access to resources, and perceived freedoms. The final reason they came was the gold rush. They came to the gold rush because they really needed the gold because they were really poor. Those were the reasons why they came to America.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I will explain what they needed to go threw to get here to America. They needed to first find a ship or boat that was going to America(that was the only thing available for them). They needed to go in storage class, where it was all crowded and cluttered. In order to get to America the needed to be well as in not ill because they&nbsp;were afraid that you would spread your illness like a virus( if ill you would be forced to return from wherever you came from). It was a dream for some but a nightmare for others. Once you got to Borneo Island you reached your long anticipated journey of getting to the land of opportunity, America.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was my article on why immigrants moved to America. The dream, hope, tragedy, and the unbelievable truth that your now there.</p>	1		20131023171059	2352	1		20131023171022	2483	2		20131025111003	2405	1

Moving from one country to another either from force or pleasure is referred to as Migration. Immigrant migrate either because they lost their jobs and are look for new ones or that they want to get away from war and conflict. During the last few centuries, migration to America has become more and more popular because America has lower unemployment rates, more money and product, and it just become better and better, Of course with all these things, word spread. And that's how it all started.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1790's America was known as a brand new country. So, people took advantage of that. By the 1800's Immigrants were coming by ship loads, looking for jobs and money. The largest group of immigrants were Germans. Then There were the Irish. The Irish came to America because they were desperate for fertile land. Potato crop failed, so they decided to grow them somewhere else, so they came to the new land. LAter&nbsp; in the 1800's other races of people came. Soon enough, every kind of person from Europe came to America. Russian, Italian, Polish, and others came to America. Jewish people were killed off in Germany, so to avoid conflict, they migrated to America. Later on in that century, going to America became fairly easier.</p>	1		20131023161052	2352	1		20131023161053	2483	1

Would you choose to stay or leave? This is the choice all people immigrating in the 1800s had to make. There are many reasons why people wanted to move to America in the 1800s. Some of them include the opportunities, freedoms, and what people can escape.</p> <p>&nbsp; If one were to move from a country to America, one reason why they would be doing it is because of the opportunities they would gain. Firstly, they would be giving their children the opportunity to live a life free of poverty and depression. This is important because they will be happy knowing that their children will have a chance to be rich and without the knowledge of terrible things, such as homelessness. Secondly, they would be able to get a job. Unlike their country, where it is usually nearly impossible to get a job, they will be equally able to get a job as that of the person sitting next to them. Lastly, the person will be able to gain the opportunity to become rich, just like the Chinese hoped. This is important because they will be able to, just like Source #3 says, &quot;return proudly to China.&quot; Not only would the person gain many opportunities, but many freedoms too.</p> <p>&nbsp; To many people, freedom of many different things is extremely essential. This is one of the main reasons why people came to America. First of all, people would gain the freedom of religion. This is important because they will be able to practice their religious beliefs without having to worry about being punished. Second of all, they will gain the right to defend themselves in court. This is also important because in some countries, people aren't allowed to defend themselves and even if they are not guilty, they are sometimes sentenced to death. Last but not least, people will have the freedom to vote for their &quot;leaders.&quot; Many people believe that it is important to be ruled by a fair leader, but when they are not able to vote, a cruel leader may come to power. People came to America in the 1800s for many reasons, one reason is because of what they can escape.</p> <p>&nbsp; When people come to America, they not only think of the opportunities and freedoms they will gain, but also what they will escape. For example, people who live during times of war can escape to America. This is important because they will not have to worry about being killed by a bomb or weapon. Another example is that people who live with a lot of siblings and their family can't provide enough food for them can move to America. In America, there will be enough food for that person and so they won't starve to death. One last example is that the people can escape poverty. Poverty is a horrible thing. People can die of illnesses because of dirty environments. But in America, there are certain rules about living conditions, and the environment won't be as harsh.</p> <p>&nbsp; Overall, there are many reasons why people moved to America from other countries such as the opportunites they would gain, the freedoms they would gain, and what they would escape.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023171054	2372	2		20131023171007	2352	2

Those reasons are called push and pulls.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushes are the reasons why people <u>had</u> to migrate to America. A push may have been people running out of food because of a lack of farmland. Another push may have been people wanting to find jobs in the new land.

They may have came for opportunities or wealth. They may have been forced to come to America because of war or lack of food.

Workers came to america for the new technology which was enoygh for them. They worked at new factories to farm, build on land, and to invent things. people moved over here to get better jobs and maybe the laws were to harsh for them. for example, the new europeans want ed to leave europe because it was harsh over there. Maybe some people wantd to go to america to get a new job otherwise they would go hungry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the rest of the people who don't have jobs neededfood, homes, and a job before they dies with starvation or they get a really bad cold because it was raining and they had no shelter to keep them warm.

Some escaped the wars and made thier life unpredictable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people that moved would really miss thier friends, but the good thing is that you could still make new friends from a different school.

Many people migrate for a reason. There was a time period where many immigrants from all over the world were moving to the United States. They moved because of the harsh environment they were living in, wars or conflicts, and poverty or they want to seek a better life. There are two different reasons why they moved. They are known as pushes and pulls. Pull is features that attract people.Pushes are feature that push the people from their home.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many reasons why immigrants choose the United States. During the 1800s industry grew, transportation improved, and had new technology. Immigrants came from Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. They needed food, homes, and jobs. They also came here to find work and and avoid hunger. Others came for religious freedom. Some Chinese immigrants came to the United States because that time the gold rush had begun. They called America the Gold Mountain, shortly they heard good news about California and many immigrants wanted to join the gold rush.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many immigrants also came to the United States because they were pushed here. The Irish, for example came during and after the war because their crops failed and there was a food shortage. Many Europeans wanted to escape harsh conditions , Russian-Jews wanted to escape prejudice and violent attacks. Italians suffered from high birth rates and farming losses.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigrants came to the United States for many reasons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023161059	2483	2		20131023161040	2368	2

So ya here it is:</p> <p>So around the 1800's a lot of people migrated from other countries to America. Many people did this because well we have a lot to offer here such as more jobs, better home's, and of course we have more rights then other people have in other places. Another reason why people moved to America is because a lot more people knew how to build, work, invent, and farm. With that said there was a lot of job opportunities, and with the technology that was being invented there was a lot for them to do. Some immigrants worked in factories, on farms, built land, and helped people invent things.</p> <p>Most of the people that were immigrants in the 1800's were Germans. Before 1860(the American Civil War) a forth of the people of Ireland(1.7 million Irish people) came to America. Many people were desperate because crops started to fail or there were a lot of food shortages. Around the later 1800's more people from different parts from all over the world started migrating to America. Some of these places included Russia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and many other places. It almost seemed as if everyone wanted to move to America. As i said in the beginning most people came for jobs and better homes but they also came for religious freedom. In the end almost 26 million immigrants moved to the United States in a 50 year period. That was honestly a lot of people but whats important is to remember that all those people moved here because we were the land of freedom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023161053	2372	2		20131023161050	2352	2

With all of the technology in the 1800's there was plenty for them to do. Immigrants did alot of things, they worked in the new factories, to farm and build on the land, and to invent things. Germans made up large single groups. The Irish were the largest immigrant group. In the 1860's one fourth of the whole population of Ireland came to America. 1.7 million Irish men, women, and children. Irish people were desperate because in Ireland crops had failed and most likely the potatoe crop. More than 1 million people died of starvation in Ireland. In the later 1800's Europeans came to America. Also other countries like Russia, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Hungary. The population of Europe was alot more between 1750 and 1850. All the rest of the people needed food</p>	1		20131023161059	2443	1		20131023161008	2372	1		20131025091027	2405	1

Several simply needed food, homes, and jobs, and they found it here. Workers who could invent, farm, or construct came to America. The technology we produced gave opportunities. They worked in factories, farmed and built on land, and invented. Those people were called immigrants. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Industry grew even more as more immigrants arrived. Transportation improved for the railroad that crossed the U.S.A. was finished. Then, steam power and the redesign of the printing press made many cheap books and newspapers. This produced news and ideas available to more people. Soon, the telegraph was invented and so was the telephone, which created faster communcation. People moved more than ever before. Environments, battle zones, and poverty drove them away from their homes. However, as the saying goes, &quot;Whenever one door closes, another door opens.&quot; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023161041	2372	2		20131023161053	2352	2

Well, put your feelings aside because this is not about you. This is about the people who migrated to America and how they actually affected America itself not like you just affecting your neighborhood or your class. There were many reasons for these immigrants to come to America. Some came for religion, while others came to escape from poverty, especially during the Gold Rush. Many came for a new life in America away from the troubles of their home country. Large amounts of people from all around the world come to America, giving it diversity in culture, food, and clothing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It began around the 1800's, where in America, newcomers could build, farm, and invent where free land was vast and not very polluted. There were new factories to be built, industries to rise, and people just waiting to become rich and famous. The largest groups of immigrants in the 1800's were the Germans and the Irish, especially the Irish, for their crops were failing, thus resulting in a food shortage, creating hunger and starvation, which would lead to death, but back to the point. Later that same century, people from the other European countries, such as Russia, Italy, the other countries in Europe.Then there were the ones who cam from places that were full of war and small amounts of religious freedom. In the end of about a 50 year period, about 26,000,000 people in America were immigrants. Seeing America today, well, that's still a lot.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who could forget the time in the world when your home county seemed horrible and America seemed like the best place in the world. This was the time when industry &quot;boomed&quot;, and the San Franciscan people might say, for their town is the &quot;Booming City&quot; or something like that. This was the time when the first U.S crossing railroad came out, when people had and easier time transporting resources, when steamships were invented. It was also the time when the telegraph and the telephone was invented, making the steam printing-pressed news travel faster. During this time was what we call push and pulls. Pushes were the things that pushed people out of their country, such as war, conflict, and the things that people don't like,&nbsp; while pulls were the things that pulled them into a new place, full of attracting things like freedom, opportunities, and freedom.</p>	2		20131023161018	2483	2		20131023161025	2372	2		20131025081032	2301	3

Some of them were pulled to America and some were pushed to America. Pushed meant the people had a hard time and wanted to move. Pulled meant the they were attracted to it and was sucked in. In this essay, I will be telling you why the immigrants moved to America.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reason why the immigrants moved to our country is so they can have a good life in America and not their home country. They were either torture,&nbsp; poor, had shortages, and more in their country, but in America they had their own rights and they were not tortured by others. For example: Europeans wanted to escape harsh conditions in Europe. this is one example of a push to America. Another example of a push is: Southern Italians suffered from birth rates and lower prices in Italy. one last example is that the Chinese were not able to pay taxes and could not produce enough rice for everyone in their party.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last reason why the outsiders came to America is so they can find gold. Many people were poor in their country. A lot Chinese moved to America because they were so attracted to gold an they were so poor. This is one example of a pull to America. People who found gold at the gold rush were named &quot;Forty-Niners&quot;. When they found gold they shouted &quot;EUREKA&quot;. Chinese called California a &quot;GOLD MOUNTAIN&quot;. People also got change in their currency. Another example is that&nbsp; when many people found out about the GOLD RUSH, they immediately packed up and went there. One last example is that everyone wanted to go to America for its natural features.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I think the people who immigrated to America made a good decision. Them immigrating made America have a very huge population and hopefully it is still growing today. The people who immigrated changed their lives in a good way. the bad thing is that they had to change their way of life in America this is why people immigrated to America.</p>	2		20131023161008	2352	1		20131023161005	2443	2		20131025101057	2405	2

One of them would to escape poverty or the conflicts going through their home country. Another reason would be for a fresh start,since America had several job openings at the time.The last reason would be for the freedom and the lure of gold or wealth.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1800s, Europe's population had doubled,and many people were sent to live in America. Poverty had taken hold, and several Europeans came to avoid starvation. People needed homes and food. Jews had fled to America,since they were mistreated for their beliefs and were persecuted. Many others came to escape the wars going on in their country,that made life unstable. The Irish left because of failing crops and Southern Italians suffered farming losses.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many more Europeans wanted a fresh start.America was a land of oppurtunity. It had several job openings in factories,farms,and many more.</p>	2		20131023161004	2368	2		20131023161057	2352	2		20131025081025	2405	1
