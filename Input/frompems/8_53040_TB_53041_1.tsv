Later in source four it goes on to say something really interesting about the colors of the building. The color of your building would say your social status. To prove this statment Edward wrote, ""Starting in the Tang dynasty, buildings were decorated based on socail status. For instance, the emperor's buildings were yelloe while goverment officials could use red, black, or blue. Other citizens had black, grey, or white homes.""

Also, in Europe during Marco Polo's lifetime, Gothic-style features were replacing the heavy stone, rounded arches, thick columns, and relatively small windows of Romanesque churches. Churches in this new style featured pointed arches, thinner columns, and tall windows that flooded the interior with light. On the other hand, ancient Chinese architctural design was controlled by the principals of ancient Chinese philosophies. One design principle that arose from these ideas concerned the height of buildings. Typically made of wood, though bricks were also used, Chinese buildings of this period emphasized width rather than height, with low ceilings and curved roofs. In the Tang dynasty (618-907),  buildings were decorated based on social status.

He not only speaks of the magnificence of the city itself, but specifically of the structures.  In Source #4, there is a description of a number of different buildings that Polo saw on his journeys. When he visited Kublai Khan, it is likely that he saw some of the buildings belonging to him colored in yellow, red, black, or blue.  Another mention of architecture in Source #4 describes a different kind of building that Polo saw; a pagoda. ""It was a type of tall tower used for religious purposes.""

This reveals that China liked to build things unusually large. However, common China was used to wide buildings instead of tall towers. Another Chinese custom was to paint buildings according to social status. In Europe, churches were being changed from stone buildings with thick columns and small windows to larger buildings with pointed arches, thinner columns and tall windows. It seems as if Europe was also beginning to build things larger than before.	2		20130828140847	1195	2		20130828140807	1455	2

I see no point in taking a test that requires so much extra and unnecessary effort.

To start out, in source three it gives a whole paragraph dedicated to describing the palaces. For example, it says that almost everything in the palace was gold or painted gold. Another example from that paragraph is how big it makes the palcace seem. The souce states that the palace  has 1000 large chambers and 20 great halls. Finally, in source 4 it states that the building colors were based on your social clss. For example, if you were a government offical, you lived in a yellow building.
