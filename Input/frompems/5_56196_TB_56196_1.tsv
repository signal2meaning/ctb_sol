I have a long and busy day ahead of me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 7:00 A.M. and I am going to the pie car for breakfast. I order sausage, eggs, and pancakes. I get some orange juice to go with it. Right now they are setting up the tent for tonight's show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is 9:30 A.M. and it is time to start practicing for tonight's show. I will be walking above a pool of sharks. I stumbled a few times but never fell.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now 3:00 P.M. and practice is over. I get a break time for 30 minutes. I am going back to my trailer to take a nap.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 P.M. It is time to help set everything up for the show tonight. I help set my tightrope and the pool of sharks up for the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 P.M. Now it is dinnertime. My friends and I go to the pie car to eat. We are all talking about the big show tonight.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:30 P.M. Show time! I am the last act of the night. I wait for a hour to go by and I am finally up. The lights face towards center stage. The announcer says,&quot;Now what you've all been waiting for Tylar Johnson!&quot; I step onto the tightrope and I keep my balance until halfway. I look down and I see the sharks going around in circles. I start wobbling and everyone in the crowd gasp. Then I think to myself pull it together Tyler. I get my balance back and walked the rest of the way. Hurray! The crowd goes wild. Everybody applauds and shouts,&quot;Tyler, Tyler, Tyler!&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:00 A.M. Ah, it's nice to be in bed. It's been a long day.

She had two kids of her own. All her life, Mrs. Dunmore&nbsp;</p> <p>wanted to be a circus performer. She had many talents but she had one that she was perfectly good at. She was good at being an acrobat. One day when she was driving to work, she passed the circus that had a sign that said,&quot; NOW HIRIRING&quot; in bold letters. She was thinking about applying for the job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs. Dunmore worked until 8:00 pm so when she came home, it was already nightime. Her kids were getting ready for bed. Mrs Dunmore ate dinner and after that, she took a shower. Once she was done, she had to talk to Mr. Dunmore about something. She told Mr. Dunmore about how she just quit her job today and how she was going to apply for the job. Mr. Dunmore was mad. When he saw Mrs. Dunmore's big, happy smile, he was happy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Today was the day Mrs. Dunmore was going to apply for the job at the circus. She walked in and to her suprise, there were eight poeple in line. She had to wait for almost half an hour until in was her turn. The boss of the circus asked her many questions. After the interveiw, she went home. She was very worried about the letter they are going to send to let you know if you got the job or not. Mrs. Dunmore was tired so she went to her bedroom and took a long nap.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Mrs. Dunmore finished her nap, it was time to pick the kids up fom school. She got in her car and drove over to thier school. When Mrs. Dunmore got to thier house, she got a snack for her kids. She helped them with thier homework if they neded help. Then Mr. Dunmore came home. The family ate dinner and got ready for bed. Mrs. Dunmore got on the bed and fell asleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, the mailman came. Mrs. Dunmore took the letter from the mailbox. It was the letter from the circus. She went back inside to the house. When she read it, she was suprised. She couldn't believe it. She got the job. She had to start tommorow. From that day on, she was a circus performer. Her and her whole entrire family was happy. They were proud of her too.</p>	2		20131023152506	539	2		20131023220047	537	2

She goes to school at Forest Park Elementary. She lives with her uncle Bozo, his real name isn't Bozo everybody calls him that because that's his clown name. He has a partner named Marty and he's a monkey! Alexis had always dreamed of being in the circus. Everybody said that she wasn't old enough yet. You have to be twelve. She told them well my birthday is coming up soon maybe she could start practicing. Her uncle told her that they would star practicing next week</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has almost been a week since Alexis's uncle said that they could start practicing. She couldn't stop thinking about it. She was so excited that she was going to practice with her uncle tomorrow that she was bouncing off the walls. It was the next day and she woke up very early. When she woke up she ran to her uncles room and shook him until he woke up. He asked her why she was up so early. She said &quot;we start practicing today.&quot; Oh&nbsp; I didn't even remember. Alexis said &quot; I couldn't forget.&quot; He said that they would go down stairs to eat breakfast first. they had pancakes, eggs, and bacon.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; After breakfast they went out side the first thing that they did out side was stretch. Alexis's uncle said that it is very important to stretch before doing anything in the circus. Then they practiced on their juggling but Alexis didn't know how to juggle. Her uncle had to teacher. After about thirty minutes she finally got it. Then they worked on the balance beam, it turns out that Alexis was pretty good with the balance beam. She had very good balance. Then they had to work on the trapeze but Alexis couldn't do it. She kept trying and trying but she couldn't do it. Since it was getting dark they went in side.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't relize that being in the circus was so hard. Her uncle told her that it is very hard work. He said that since we just started practicing you won't be able to be in the circus even if you are twelve. Alexis said that she didn't want to be in the circus anymore she thought it was to hard. Her uncle wouldn't let her quite he said that he had to do the same thing and now he's in the circus so she can do it to.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been three years since Alexis started training and now she's in the circus to. She does so many things inthe circus she's a clown, she's a trapieze artist like she always wanted to be, she a;so works with the elephants and tigers and she couldn't be any happier. If she didn't listen to her uncle she would have never made it to the circus.</p>	2		20131023154803	935	2		20131024085427	562	2		20131025140712	539	2

It would be fun to see the gymnast doing the tightrope or the swing thing. One thing I'd like to see is the lion taming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in this paragraph I will tell more about there life like when they get up when they go to sleep. Okay so when they wake up it is 7:00 AM at that time they also go to the pie cart where they eat. 9:00 AM they go to school and since the circus travels around the world you often go to school with people who speak a different language. 3:00 PM school is over when it is over the kids play on the unicycles, tightrope, and juggling. 3:30 is when they practice and do there chores which is usually feed and give new water to the horses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I will continue what I saying 6:30 it is time for dinner they go back to the pie cart but they don't usually eat because it is almost time for the show. It is 10:30 the is over and they go back to there sleeping area. Now I will tell you about how bad it is at the circus everybody thinks the circus is great but it is not most people of going back home because on tour they don't get to call a place home. Most people in the circus ran away from home so they could do what they wanted.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now I will tell you about the good things on of the circus the good things are you get to travel the world&nbsp; and you get a thrill from doing stunts. You also get to have a family of 100 people because they all act like a family. Most people have to join when your young because you can develop your skills young rather than later. It also gives you more experience from the circus. Now you know about the circus so have fun.</p>	1		20131024112649	693	1		20131024125429	556	2		20131025153642	543	1

We live in New York, well, at least right now. Being a circus performer means lots of time on the road. You don't really have a place to call home. You also have to practice a lot. Falling during a show would be pretty embarrassing... Don't think you get out of school either. I'm 11 and I have to go to school on the road. Dinner's aren't as huge as you'd think, being a circus performer and all. Sleep is a little low too. I don't get to bed until about 12:00.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The circus is fun. You get to ride horses and other animals. If you are a acrobat, you get to hang upside down and swing around. Clowns get to honk horns and be silly all day. Imagine that! You can be a tightrope walker, too. They walk on skinny ropes high in the air, and sometimes perform tricks while doing it. Watching the special circus animals is a blast! They're trained to do lots of cool tricks. So, it's not all bad being a circus performer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Don't let all this ruin your dream if you want to be a circus performer. Hard work isn't always a bad thing. I love life being in the circus, but it's nice to be home every once and a while. All that being said, Circus's are great, and so is being in them!</p>	2		20131024112650	693	2		20131024144656	541	2

I at first was not sure if I wanted to run away but my parents were very mean so I decided to run away.Now I am part of the North American Circus. I am a lion tamer at my circus, but I am not very good yet seeing that I just joined a while ago into the circus. I am working on teaching my lion Pedro how to jump through a hoop! He is not quite ready for it though so we are still working on it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When I first joined the circus I thought it was going to be easy but boy, was I wrong! In the circus I have to get up at 7:05 every</p> <p>morning so I can get to the pie car to get the bacon and eggs before everyone else. So, after I finish eating my breakfast I have approximately 15 minutes to get ready for school which is at 8:00. That is just my morning, I will tell you more about my afternoon later but right now I am going to take you to my circus school. Well, first I only really do have American classmates, so I don't really have to worry about having to speak any foreign languages. My teacher Mr. Nussbat is really funny and is a great teacher. He really likes to teach math even though I am not that big of a fan of math. Yet today is a special day and Mr. Nussbat knows it, today is my first day of performing at the circus! So today Mr. Nussbat says that today he is going to lets us all out early so we can practice our acts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So, after we get out of school early I quickly make my way over to Pedro my lion so we can work on our tricks for tonight's show.</p> <p>Me and Pedro then work on our hoop trick and Pedro has finally got it, now we are in good shape to perform tonight. So then after that it is about 4:30 so I head over to the pie car to grab some early dinner because I want to&nbsp; be able to get some food then head over to the circus tent to get all set up for the circus show. It is now 7:00pm and me and Pedro are about to go on, I hope we can wow the crowd! It is now a bit after ten o' clock and I can still hear the crowds cheering from outside the tent in the trailer where I live. The crowds loved me because they didn't believe that A boy my age could be a lion tamer, but did I show them that I could be! So, now i am sitting in my trailer listening to some music from my iPod since it helps me cool down after an intense night.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I hope you liked my story</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The End</p>	2		20131024112722	690	2		20131024131047	935	2

You have to practice some new acts every month. I think it is fun too, but I do a lot of exercise every once in a while. Last week I went to Italy to perform. I had lots of fun there because before the show I went to many gift shops and bought stuff.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also need to wake up early to eat breakfast. I eat breakfast at eight in the morning.&nbsp; At nine I get ready to change into my normal clothes, at nine thirty I go to school. School is as fun as being in the circus. I like reading, writing, and math, but my favorite part is going to resses. Then at ten through three I prepare for the next show. Next, at three through seven I prepare dinner. And Finally it is show time at eight.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today in my show I did a lot of flips, but my favorite thing to do is make funny jokes at the end of the show. My family's favorite thing to do is play with the wild crowd. They like to give out free stuff like t-shirts, toys, and small glow sticks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the best show I have ever done in my whole carrer.

You also have to have a talent that you are very good at and that you will practice every day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;If you want to be a tightrope walker you need to practice every day. Tightrope walkers have to be consentrated the whole time. So if you want to be a tightrope walker you have to be very consentreated and not be distracted easily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;If you want to be a circus clown you don't really need to pracctice. All you need to do is be funny. You have to natrully funny and dress incorectlly. You also need to make people laugh easily.</p>	1		20131021132858	690	1		20131021151348	537	1

I did not want to do this, but now this is my life. I was born January 28, 2002 in La&nbsp; Circusa, the most popular circus in Paris. My parents, Lucy and Francessco,are trapeze artists, my big brother, Max, is a tightrope walker and was in high school.&nbsp;I am an acrobat performer and am in middle school 6th grade.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 4 years old all kinds of dancing classes at the school built in the circus. Ballet, Jazz, Tap Dancing, The Salsa and Break Dancing . Then when I was 7 years old I became an acrobat. At first I thought all the training and late night shows was all fun. But then every night I seemed to get more and more tired&nbsp; and stressed, then along with that I had to go to school and wake up at 7:00 a.m. in the morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why but I could never go to sleep. Then one night I heard the ring master yelling and&nbsp; animals roaring and whimpering. The ring master would never do that I thought, so my brain told me it was all just a dream. So I settled down in my small bed and slowly drifted to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bellina&quot;, called my mother. &quot;Coming&quot;, I called. I checked my clock, 6:05 a.m.!! &quot;Mom, why so early&quot;, I shout. Your school starts early today because you have an extra hour of acrobat classes&quot;, my mom shouts back.Uhhhhhhhhh, I think.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I.....am.......so......so..............tired&quot;!!, I say. Sulking into bed, I am soooooooooooooooooo tired. But then I perk up, once again I hear the ring master shouting and animals roaring and whimpering. Then I think the animals had been very scared when the ring master came close to them, know that you think of it, the ring master had been glaring at the animals.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to see what was going on. I slippedd out of bed without making a noise and look at the tents, until I see a tent with animals and the ring master in it. I peek in, oh my gosh. He was trying to teach them tricks, but then one did something wrong and he whipped them!!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to report him, it was mean to sabotage animals. I had to run and tell my parents.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning the ring master was in chains and would remain that way. &quot;We are so proud of you&quot;, my family says.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Aditi Salunkhe</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023114026	77	2		20131023114526	543	2

When he joinef=d the circus the realized that it wouldn't be all fun and clowning around. It was hard work.

They have a one-room schoolhouse which travels with them. They did a lot of traveling as a circus. It is just like any school with computers, tests, and report cards. There are circus performers from all over the world, so many classmates speak French, Russian, and Italian.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:00, school is over so it is time for a quick break. The clowns let you play on their unicycles, and juggle. He likes to play with his tiny dog, Seymour. Glenn really wanted to join a soccer team, but they were never in one place enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:30, he had to do chores and practice for the show tonight. He took care of the horses for the horseback acts. He was working on leaping of a trampoline onto a horse's back. Other kids were working on juggling or acrobatics. His neighbor was walking baby leopards on a leash. The trainers were working with all different kinds of animals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6:30, his family at dinner at the pie car. They try not to eat much becausetheir show is tonight. They do 10 shows a week: one each Wednesday, plus a manitee on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30, the show is over and he is wiped out. Walking back to his trailer, he passes the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. Two days from now they will be in another town.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is 12:00, he is in bed. He is thinking about the end of the touring season. It will be nice for him to go home in Florida. When he grows up he still wants to be a circus performer. The circus is fun, but it is a busy and tough life.</p>	2		20131022082708	539	1		20131022100513	562		N	20131023091208	552	2

There are some good parts in joining the circius like you get to travel the world and see now things and you will have fun performing and when you look in the audience's face they will cheer and scream.

Well, the circus is a colossal place filled with amazing and bizarre things! Guess what? I know someone who works at one. My best friend Alexis is an acrobat at the Big Blue circus. She has lots of work to do, but she has fun doing it. One summer day she told me every single thing she dose!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First she gets up at 6:46 A.M. every morning. She gets her clothes on and goes to the Pie Car to eat a scrumptious breakfast, if she is not all the way awake, sometimes her mom throws a pie in her face to wake her up! Then she goes to training in the Train to be a better acrobat car. Alexis and her partner Joshua swing from trapezes and jump into each others arms. At approximately 12:13 P.M., she hurries back to the pie car to eat a yummy lunch, it is usually a stake burger and seasoned french fries with a sweat tea on the side. and then she does her chores. She has to groom the horses, dress the monkeys and elephants, practice her part of the show, and get the stage ready. And finally at about 4:35 P.M. the show will go on! It starts with the tamer and lions, followed by the courageous motor cycle drivers, and then the hilarious clowns, then the magical musician, and last but not least the amazing acrobats, Alexis and Joshua! After the show the circus has games and they let you ride ponies, and elephants, and they even let you play with the amazingly bizarre monkeys! When everything is done, she goes to her trailer, which she shares with her mom, brother's, and sister, and gets ready for bed. It is 11:59 P.M. when she gets in bed and starts to fall asleep. The next day she does the same thing over again, whenever she has time she writes me a letter. Most of the letters just say how she has been doing, when she will be in town next, and she asks how I'm doing. I can't wait to see her next week, I think I want to be an acrobat someday, too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been thinking and I think I'm going to join the circus. Do you think that is a good idea? I think it sounds pretty fun! Maybe one day Alexis and I can perform together, that would be fun. I'll have to think a little bit longer.</p>	2		20131022165014	562	2		20131023131555	693	2

There were clown-like people going down the isle interacting with the crowd. And then it all began.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was so amazing seeing people flying through the air, walking on tine wire, and riding a horse trough a ring of fire.

My sister then came in to my room and told me that she was going to drivers ed that day and couldn't come to my Ariel practice.That made me even more unhappy.Quickly I through on my dance shoes and sprinted out the door.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we were driving I told mom how hard it was going to be for me to be away from her, dad, my sister and my friends for what seemed like forever. Really though it was only a couple of weeks while I was in Las Vegas preforming in Cirque Du Soleil. I was so exited, it was going to be the best weeks of my life. But I was also scared. I knew that it would be really, really hard to go all the way. What if I mess up. I said silently to myself.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we were at the dance and Ariel studio. When I walk in I see all of the amazing people on the tight ropes and people holding themselves up on little ribbons, like scarfs,one hundred feet up. &quot;That's going to be you.&quot; mom said as she was looking above to see all of the people that do Ariel. &quot;I know&quot; I said with a scared face. She told me not to worry and not to be scared. But how could I not worry, i mean I don't have a spotter in the show and I'm still learning. She kissed my forehead, and my coach came out to come and get me. It was time,time to train. We started with lots of stretching. Leg up and down. Left leg splits now right leg splits, lots of middle splits and a ton of conditioning. &quot;Climb that rope girl, faster faster.&quot; came my coach's voice. So faster I went. I was at the top, i rang the bell and slowly, to make sure I didn't tear up my hands, came down. Next it was time for the real work. I harnessed up and in the air I went.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I flipped and there were definitely a few flops. But over all practice was all right. When I got done I said goodbye to mom and now I was in the hands of my coach. For th next few days I trained long hours. Now it was time to go. we got on th bus and away we went to Las Vegas. Today was the day. My parents were coming to see me preform and so were a whole bunch of my friends. I was nervous, but I knew that I could do it.</p> <p>&nbsp; It was time the audience was getting seated. They were announcing that the show was to begin. up up up I climbed, then the music started. It was amazing I was going crazy flips and everything was going so well until, My best friend Alisha's harness broke. She was doing the kind of move here you are required to wear a harness. In a split second, she fell to the ground, the hard stage. There was a massive and ear splitting scream that came from her.Quickly, I descended from my ribbons. She was lying there, for what seemed like forever until someone got to her. She was screaming. I asked her what hurt but she wouldn't say. I helped her sit up and finally, she was taken to a hospital.I had to go with her so did her parents. When we got to the hospital, they took lots of e-rays of her entire body until they were positive at what was broken. She had a fracture in her lower back, a broken ankle, and a sprained wrist. the doctors said that she was lucky to get away with only those injuries. She was finally awake, but she woke only to find herself in pain and we had to tell her that she could never do Ariel again.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now you can see that there are many tragedies in this beautiful sport, but it is amazing and should be kept alive forever. When I got home I told my mom that now I had a reason to be scared but I will still keep dreaming. Soon i joined the Cirque du Soleil. I have never looked back. And guess who will be joining me my next show, Alisha! She had lots of surgeries and a ton of physical therapy, but now she's back, and better than ever.</p>	2		20131024102637	541	2		20131024113936	562	2

It had been 15 minites ago when the show was supposed to start and they still couldn't find the missing elephant! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They later asked us if we could look for it. I soon got out of my seat and started searching.I looked around the snack bar, but didn't find it. Then I found a door that had a sign on it that said Keep Out. I went inside, there I saw an elephant, with an engured leg. I soon got the staff, and tried not to panic.When the staff came in they took the elphant and put it into an animal hospital. The veternarians were able to heal it's leg. The trainer said I may have saved it , and gave me backstage passes. I was real glad I saved the elaphant,Maggy.

It is very difficult to tame lions to do tricks that make the crowd go wild. I go on tours to preform all the time with my aunt and uncle because they say I have &quot;talent&quot; for teaching their lions to do tricks. They call me, &quot;their big cat whisperer&quot;.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first day is always the most fun. I get to play with the lions that smother you with their long, shiny, and golden manes. I have to keep a journal about the lions writing down, <b>Day one: Lions happy</b><b>, brushed, and fed</b>.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After playing with the lions, I go to see what my uncle is doing. Since he is the director, he is practicing what to say and what order to say them in. Watching him talk to himself is boring, I thought so I went to see what my was doing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt walks the tightrope so it is a lot of fun to watch her. She teaches me a lot about tightropes and how she can balance so well. She says the key is concentration, watch something that is moving still, and you know it will not move. &quot; DO NOT look below the tightrope. If you do, you will be afraid at the height you are at, and fall.&quot; she tells me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is ten o'clock, I usually go to bed at midnight, but my uncle says I have to get some more sleep than usual because I have to preform tomorrow. I am pretty scared because what if I mess up? What if the lions attack me? Well, I guess I will figure out tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Wake up sleepyhead!'', says my uncle and aunt. ''Todays the Big Top day!'', they coo. They try to make Big Top day sound like a joke. Got to go see the lions and feed them. ''Goodbye, got to feed the big cats!'', I say to them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lions look so happy to see me! They growled at me in a playful manner and played with my tangled hair. ''Show is in thirty minutes, feed them, brush your hair, and&nbsp; get on your costume!, my uncle yells. ''OK.'', I shout back.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UH-OH! Time for the circus! I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach. As I go backstage, I hear,&nbsp; ''Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages! Welcome to the Banzini Bros. circus!!!!'' My uncle sounds happy this morning to preform. ''O-o-okay,'' I stutter to myself, I preform after my aunt.''</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's my turn. The lions are ready for me out in the areana. I just need to remember what order I practiced in. 'Introducing.... The lion tamer!''&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022100338	935	2		20131022111947	556	1		20131023140420	552	2

Ok well what I like about the&nbsp; Circus is the Acrobats because what they have to do is they have to practice every night before the concert so they will be really good during their performance.I am going to write a story abot the Acrobats!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once apon a time there was a little girl named Lilly. She lives in Dallas, Texas with her mom. One day Lilly went to school, she walked in and saw a poster that said &quot;Dallas Circus is here!&quot; she was so excited because she wants to be in a circus.Under that it said &quot;Help Wanted&quot; so instead of going home after school Lilly went to the place were the circus needed help.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Lilly got there there was a lady at a desk and said &quot;How may i help you?&quot;Lilly said &quot;I'm here to help.&quot; th lady gave Lilly the form for the application. Lilly filled it out and gave it to her.The lady said nicely&quot; Ok Lilly we'll give you a call to let you now if your in the circus.&quot; Lilly said &quot;Ok have a nice day,&quot; the lady said&quot; You to.&quot; Lilly left and when she got home her mom said &quot;Where have you been younge lady?&quot;&quot;I may have a job!&quot; Lilly said excitedly. &quot;Well what kind of job?&quot;her mom said a little mad. &quot;At a circus.&quot;lilly said.Her mom said &quot; Ok is somebody going to be calling here for you?&quot; Lilly said&quot; Yes mother.&quot; The next day after Lilly got home from school, her mom said sadly &quot; Lilly come here.&quot; Mom why are you crying?&quot; Lilly said. Her mom said &quot; your dad is dead.&quot; Lilly started crying too. Her mom held her until they stopped crying and said &quot; Lilly I have good news!&quot; Lilly said &quot;What mom?&quot; Her mom said &quot; You made the circus!&quot; Lilly was so excited. On Lillys first day of practice she got to the building where they had to pratice Lilly got inside and thought wow theres all different kinds of things here. Then Lillys first show came and her mom and friends were in the audience after the show every body clapped and cheered. Her mom bought her flowers and said &quot; These are from daddy and he wanted me to give these angel wings to you before he died.&quot; Lilly said &quot; Thank you mom and dad I love you.&quot; after that Lilly had the best 8 years of her life with her mom and dad before he died. Lilly grew up and had a family just like her own family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The End</p>	1		20131024093336	556	1		20131024113934	562	2		20131025144308	495	1

We travel&nbsp; 20,000 miles in seven months each year visiting 150 cities. we all work tell sunup to sundown. My typical day for me7:00 ami wake up, I get dressed, and go to the pie car for pankcakes and bacon. the crews are setting up tents,lights, and music fir tonight's show. 9:00 A.M. School time. our one room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school, ours has computer, tests, and repoort cards. Because the circus performers are from all over&nbsp; the world many of my classmates speak other languages: French, Russian, and Italian, like my family. As we travel around the&nbsp; country, our geograph lessons come alive.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:00 P.M. School,s over time for a play with their a quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I also play with my tiny dog, Noodle; our trailer is too small for a lage pet. I'd like to join a soccer team, but we're never in one place long enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 P.M. Chores and practice. I feed,water,groom, the horses we use in our houseback acts. Today, my dad practices&nbsp;&nbsp; somersaultting off a running horse. I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration. Other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash. Trainers are working with elephants,lions,and chimpanzees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:30 P.M.The show&nbsp; is over. i'm wiped&nbsp; out. walking back to our trailer, we pass the circus offices,concession stands, stables,and trailers. Two days from now, we'll all set up in another town.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:00 A.M. In bad. I'm thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be a nice to go back to our real home in Florida. When I&nbsp; grow up, will Istill be a circus perfomer like my parents? Who knows?

I had&nbsp;never been to a circus before and I didn't know what it was like. I ask my parent what it was like but they didn't tell me very much about it.</p> <p>&nbsp; So the next day at school I went to the library and checked out some books about the circus. The book told about clowns, acrobats, and tightrope walkers it all looked really cool.</p> <p>&nbsp; When the day of the circus finally came I was really excited. I had even started thinking about joining the circus. The circus was really cool I saw clowns, acrobats, tightrope walkers, elephants, and even lion trainers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; When it was over I didn't &nbsp;want to leave but my parents told me we would go to a circus again sometime. While we were walking out one of the performers asked me if I would like to join the circus. I told him yes but when I came the first day I knew that I wasn't going to like being in a circus. The reasons I wouldn't like it is the fact that I wouldn't get to see my friends or family very much and I would get to rest very much and I would have travel a lot so I wouldn't have a real house to live in.</p> <p>&nbsp;I didn't end up joining the circus but they told me that since I tried to join they would get me free tickets to all their shows that was awesome.</p> <p>&nbsp; Now I still go to the circus and watch them perform and I still get free tickets but I still haven't joined. But last summer was great for me because I found something I like to do. And if I wouldn't have gone to the circus I never would have found out that I liked to go to the circus and I never would have got to try something new. That's why last summer was one of the best summers I have ever had.</p>	1		20131023130432	556	1		20131023134909	537	1

No point trying to convince myself this is &quot;only a dream&quot;.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, just as soon I stopped arguing with myself, a man with a long beard called out stiffly &quot;<b>Ledwin, Jeff</b><b>!</b>&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stepped forward. Would I make the acrobatics team? I looked at the jury.

He gaped at me (as was everyone else was) for only a few seconds before I had collided with him. His head had collided with the hard dirt floor. Then a horrible <b>RIP!</b> was heard.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metal pole was crashing down on Mr. Lungson! I lunged once again, but this time not toward Mr. Lungson, but toward the metal pole. I jumped up, grabbed hold of the pole, and brought the pole down as I landed square on my feet. &quot;<b>RUN!</b>&quot; I commanded Mr. Lungson as I strained to hold up the heavy metal pole.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>CRRACK!</b> I let out a shrill scream. My arm was searing with pain. It felt like someone had lit my arm on fire!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He broke his arm!&quot; yelled the young man. &quot;Call an ambulance!&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing I remember is Mr. Lungson sneering as he stepped on my broken arm. I called his name again and again until he ran out of sight with the young man chasing after him in the summer air. Then I felt a sharp blow to my head.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then woke up again in a hospital room. &quot;You're safe,&quot; said a doctor. &quot; He's been arrested for causing serious injury and inflicting serious pain consciously.&quot; That had lifted my spirits. Then, without warning, my insides seemed to be celebrating. And then I knew that I had done the right thing be saving even my enemy's life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The End!</p>	2		20131024113829	935	2		20131024142504	562	2

A man floating in air, one on a lion's back. He heard the ring master call for a volunteer to help him with the next part of the act. Brady stood up and waved his hand in the air frantically, he had no idea what he was in for. The ring master walked right up to him and said, &quot;Son, you ready for the time of your life?&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He lead Brady down the steps and on to the stage. Brady saw a cloth looking thing fall from the ceiling. The ring master said &quot;Grab hold for a wild ride.&quot; with a gleam in his eyes. Brady looked at the ring master and grabbed hold of the cloth. The ring master secured him in place and started swinging the cloth.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Brady was lifted out of the air and was twirling around. He remembered watching this the last time he came. As he was twirling around it felt like he was flying, the wind rushing at him it felt so good on his face. Soon it was over. As he returned to his seat he made a promise to himself, that he would be in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp; He convinced his mom to let him join just when he turned 11. He didnt know what to do but he got himself in a very famous circus. They tested him on many things and decided that he woiuld be a lion tamer. Nothing like it, a kid who tames lions. It would make millions.</p> <p>&nbsp; As he came close to the first beast Brady trembled with fear.He had a whip and a chair in a fancy costume.The lion bared his teeth and lunged. He tried his best to look brave and lashed out with the whip. The lion whimpered and recoiled in fear. Brady went straight up to it and stroked its mane.</p> <p>&nbsp; Brady went to the pie car to get some food and saw an old man drinking prune juice. He didn't understand why the old man was there. When Brady went over to the man it seem he allready new what was happening. He stood up and said &quot;I'm here because I'm the old lion tamer, when they run out of lion tamers I take their place, I'm very good with lions.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp; He sat Brady down and they started talking all about lion taming and what that man did before he was a lion tamer. The old man shared many stories with Brady and Brady liked them all.</p> <p>&nbsp; As he listened he realized that this man had been with lions his whole life and he never wanted to stop. Brady said thank you for the stories and raced off to find the ring master. When he finally found him he told him about the old man and his plan, the ring master loved it. So when Brady's mom came to see the show, she didnt just see Brady, she saw Brady and the old man side by side doing what they loved. That night, as Brady lay in bed, he dreamed about being an old man and telling a new child all the stories of his past.</p>	2		20131024113907	537	2		20131024135902	693	2

For example they shoot water at you pull pranks and sometimes even make balloons for you.Also there is the circus tightrope, what they do is the there's a rope 70ft&nbsp; from the ground and they have to walk on it all the way across with out falling but if they do fall there's a giant net to save them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; When i went to a circus there were a lot different act then usual like for example these big people and elephant&nbsp; went on these huge balls and try to balance themselves on it without falling. One person fell and broke his arm.then they brought tigers. They were so cool they had white, brown, and light brown. They&nbsp; jumped through hoops then they lit the hoop on fire and the biggest tiger jumped through it. The crowd went crazy but that was a bad idea&nbsp; the tiger got scared&nbsp; and it took the a lot of time to put it in the cage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Then there was a guy he went on two horses backs and rode them and he didn't even fall. Also there was the acrobats the went hundred feet high&nbsp; on a rope doing back flips, front flips,and etc. So if you want to be part of a circus crew think about the effects.</p>	1		20131022165337	562	2		20131023090228	541	1		20131024222350	543	1

I am Bill the Amazing and I work in Atlanta's Great Traveling Circus.&nbsp; I will tell you of a turn of events at the circus.&nbsp; It was a clear morning in Atlanta. Everything went as normal and everyone was getting ready for the big show that night.&nbsp; Some people that were getting ready were Jill the Trapeze artist, Henry the lion tamer and Dominic the Man that can walk on Fire. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Everything went as planned that day until the show.&nbsp; All the performers did a great job, Henry surprised the audience by doing tricks with the snow leopard instead of his famous lion taming act<b>, </b>Jill did a great job, and Dominic was pure amazing.&nbsp; Everything was great until my act, the grand finale.&nbsp; This night I was going to do truly amazing, something that had never been done before.&nbsp; Anyways, while the stage crew got the stage ready for my act but the snow leopard acted up and it broke Jill's arm.&nbsp; She had to be transported to the hospital and everyone wanted to be with her because we are like family but the director said that the show must go on.&nbsp; They also had to get the snow leopard out of the building in case it acted up again and seriously injured someone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone was waiting for my act, so I toughed out the longing sensation to go to the hospital and I came out to perform my act.&nbsp; Everyone cheered so loud when I came out it was such a great feeling.&nbsp; I started to perform my act when, and very surprisingly a giant elephant came from supposedly the neighboring traveling circus that was also in town it came right through the opening in the tent and was raging like a bull.&nbsp; Instantly I reacted.&nbsp; My circus training really paid off, I jumped out of the way just in time before the elephant came and would've killed me.&nbsp; Next, Dominic came out and tried to distract the elephant before it went running into the crowd but even with all his efforts it could not be stopped.&nbsp; Then I jumped into action and jumped right onto the top of the elephant.&nbsp; It reared up and I almost fell off but I managed to stay on and grab the reigns that were on the elephant I pulled them as hard as I could and the elephant instantly stopped and was looking very puzzled.&nbsp; At that moment everything went silent and the chaos stopped.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the elephant just collapsed and the whole crowd gawked at the sight of the beast lying on the ground.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I had to get off of the elephant which was quite a tricky task.&nbsp; Right when I got off we could hear the sirens blaring.&nbsp; Then the animal control came and god bless them.&nbsp; We all wanted the elephant out of the tent and they did a tremendous job of that.&nbsp; Soon, Jill heard of this news and the staff at the hospital let her come and see us.&nbsp; She was so glad that none of us were seriously injured</p> <p>and everyone else was too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough everything was back to normal and luckily no one was hurt during the elephant incident.&nbsp; They finally let me do my awesome act.&nbsp; I swallowed 50 swords and 1 lead ball.&nbsp; I got such a big applause from the audience you wouldn't even believe it and after that night no more incidents occured at Atlanta's Great Traveling Circus.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022100547	556	2		20131022120003	693	2

As a trapeze artist you swing around on something that is kind of like a monkey bar that moves back and forth. When you jump off a bar, you can do flips in the air before grabbing on to another one.</p>	2		20131024102108	539	2		20131024113935	562	2

When we are done then we will make the posters and every one is invited but they have to sign piece of paper and put how many people is going.&nbsp; While we are waiting we are going to practice our old circus moves and magic tricks.We also rent animals to do tricks ,and we use the old ones, but if they died then we just rent a new animal to replace that one. When we are done then we will count how many people are coming and we will put the chairs in a row and put their and names on the chair.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the circus is starting I will be the host and the other people will be the performers. It is from 7:00 to 12:00 so it is 5 hours, we are also selling popcorn, peanuts, and soda. So their clowns juggling and their are bears riding a bike, and magic people disappearing, their are also other circus stuff that are funny and dangerous.That is what my circus life is like.</p>	1		20131023151146	552	0		20131023162731	562	2		20131025133324	543	1

They have to work at sunup intill sundown. I really love the circus like the lions, clowns,and trapeze artist. If i was in a part of the circus i would probally have to work hard intill my act was good and i didn't ever did it wrong.

Their life and jobs are harder than you think. The &quot;<b>fun&quot;</b> jobs you could choose from are Acrobat, Lion taming, Clown, Juggling, Ring Master, and Training Animals. These jobs <b>seem</b> fun but they're actually hard. Keep reading and I'll tell you more details about life in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An acrobat is a thrilling and difficult job. I think it's cool how they can balance on tight rope. Sometimes they use bicycles and carry people on the tightrope! Sometimes they launch each other out of cannons . That is what an acrobat does.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a trapeeze is hard. You&nbsp; jump from rope to rope while doing flips in the air. Sometimes 3 or 4 people are all in the air at once. Then they go back on the ropes with out anyone falling. That's what a trapeeze does.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ringmaster is basically the host of the show. He makes the announcements about the performers. He usually wears a black. red, and white costume. The ringmaster is always the last act of the performance.That is what a ringmaster does.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lion tamers teach the lions to do tricks that a lion in the wild wouldn't do. The tamers have to put a cage around the center of the tent just incase one of the lions would jump at the people. Some of the tricks that the tamers teach are to stand up and jump through the hoops.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal trainers have the job of training the animals that perform in the circus. They train animals such as horses, lions, snakes, leopards, elephants, seals, and monkeys. The trainers have to make sure they are properly trained so they don't attack the trainers and audience. Trainers also have to make sure that the animals are fed, given water, and groomed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know how hard it is to work in a circus. The people in the circus have to do their jobs every day. It gets tiring having to do that every day. If you want to join the circus you have to be determined and hard-working daily.That's life in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>THE END</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022100514	562	2		20131022120057	537	2

First the clown act comes on. Next the acrobats do their thing. Then, the jugglers come on.Last but not least me and Alexis. So when we went on i went blank. the good thing was Alexis know what to do.Alexis was doing flips and amazing tricks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last the show ends.

Three years later Robinson joined the circus and he was just fifteen. Robinson loved the circus the first day he got there and he was so excited to be apart of it. The first thing they had him do was meet all of the animals so he can get used to them and so the animals can get used to him. Then Robinson ate and started to train with the other people in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After three months of living with people in the circus and training Robinson got to perform in front of a live audience for the first time ever after only training. On Robinson's first act he jumped of a diving board from fifteen feet high. When he jumped the man who created all of this Derrick Jeter grabs him while he hangs on the rope and then they flip onto the other side. So on his first try Robinson Cano had completed his first act with Derrick Jeter.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then after Derrick Jeter had retired Robinson Cano took over as the owner of the circus and became the most talked about man in the whole entire world.

So, maybe some of you may think that the circus is always fun and games. Well, only sometimes. But, most of the time it's just work, work, work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are things that I do in the circus everyday. The first thing I do is wake up in the morning and get dressed. The clothes that I change into have to be just casual clothes. Anyway, the next thing I do is go to the pie car to eat breakfast with the other performers. The next thing I do might surprise some kids.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next thing I do is go to school. I know, I know it's weird to go to school in the circus. But we circus performers need our education. Without it, we wouldn't have known how to do flips - or anything that we can do. So, it's not that weird anymore right? Good.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the next thing I do in the circus is to take a break in school. After the break, we do chores and practice. Chores is the thing I hate the most. But, it's life in the circus. Now for PRACTICE!!!!!! I love practice! Practice is my favorite thing to do in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all that practice it's dinnertime! And boy I'm starving! But the thing is, I can't eat to much. Do you know why???? It's because it's almost showtime!!!!! And I am super excited! Wish me luck on my show!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whew! Show's over. And boy aren't I tired! Everyone did great! Including me. Haha! So, finally it's time for bed.Well, goodnight reader! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........................</p>	2		20131022205427	545	2		20131023133153	562	2		20131025094104	543	2

Everything went wrong. But thats only because somebody was sabotaging us. One of our biggest rivals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First i'll start with what happend to me, Roger the Clown.It was the middle of July we were doing one of the biggest shows of our careers.Our show was in New England and the Queen of England was watching our show. I had just finished my first act perfectly but then came my unicycle act. I was riding my unicycle around when it broke down I checked it and it turns out somebody screwed of my bolts. I tried to cover it up with my french horn, but something was stuck in it. So I ran of the stage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next were the Byron Brothers the twin acrobats of the Century. They were doing all there acts correctly until the tightrope act. They climed the ladder smiling at the audience. They were doing great but for their finishing move the amazing thriple backflip. They landed perfectly on the rope but the rope snaped and they fell onto the net.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And last the Amazing and Beautiful Miss Pico. She was Dancing Beautiful on Stage.But this was the baddest thing that happened tonight. When she was dancing her heel of her shoe broke and she broke her ankle. But then we saw a strange man leaving the arena with a hat and a big coat. we also saw him with a pocket knife in his hand and a screwdriver in his back pocket. He looked backed and I saw his face&nbsp; and I knew that face. It was the manager of our rival Circus .</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I started chasing him and caught him. I turned him in to the cops and he had to serve 5 years of Jail&nbsp; for sabotage and pay for miss Pico's Medical bill.That was our worst Circus show ever. But the good thing is the Queen of England offered us to do a private show for her because we didn't get to show her our best. So when we did the private sow we Aced it. That was the worst Circus show ever!!!!!!</p>	2		20131022164939	562	2		20131023130337	541	2

At first I didn't think I had the right body form, but I was determined. Later I got a message that said I made it. I practiced a lot until I was 15 when there were circus tryouts. I asked my gymnast coach ans she said I should go for it, because I had the highest standards in my gymnastics class. I practiced for about 2 1/2 weeks when the day came. When I performed the judge was stunned that I hadn't missed a single test. I was so happy when I made it.</p> <p>&nbsp;Everyday is a new, hard, and well practiced day. We do a lot of</p> <p>traveling we travel about 15,000 miles every 6 months and vist about 125 cities. We have been to every country so far and to half of the states in North America such as South Carolina, Hawaii, and even Florida.</p> <p>Everday I wake up at 7:30 A.M. and get ready to start doing</p> <p>warm ups for about 2 hours. Some things I do for warmups are jumping jacks, flips on the trampoline, and tosses. At 9:30 me and the rest of the acrobats line up with their partners. First me and my partner go. We showand tell the rest of the acrobats what they need to do. Sometimes me and my partner will teach them some new acrobatics like the triple toss and throw. Later at 12:00 we have lunch. Then at 12:30 we take class lessons where we learn about the precise angle of our throws and tosses and couple more things like that. Later at 3:00 we have our break were we have to feed and groom the horses, elephants, tigers, and the rest of the animals.Finally at 4:00 for the rest of the day until 8:00 when we leave we practice performing and getting ready.</p> <p>Since, we travel a lot I don't get to see my family a lot. Plus,</p> <p>there is no place to call my home when we move all the time. Beside the fact I don't ever get to see my family I live the life here with all of my circus friends and always there to cheer someone up at shows.</p>	1		20131023115511	556	1		20131023150658	541	1		20131025104453	539	1

I knock on his door and he says come in. &quot;Dad I need to talk to you.&quot;I say. The way I said it sounds like it's life serious. I wish i could've said that different. &quot;OK, what's up buttercup?&quot; &quot;I want to be a marine bioligist. I love this life that I'm living but this is not for me.&quot; &quot;I know.&quot;He says sadly. &quot;How do you know?&quot; &quot;You are the smartest little girl in the world. You love to do acrobatics but as a hobby. Anybody can read you.&quot; Thanks for understanding,dad.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; My life has changed scince that talk.

Everyone including the clowns assured me that I would be fine but I was suspicious of all of them. Moments later it was time for my act, I slowly walked onstage and up the ladder to the acrobatic post where I jumped off and onto the pedastool then listened for someone to cut the rope holding the pedastool. I listened for about two minutes before I heard someoone sawing at the rope and it was none other than Ginechi himself he soon finished sawing and then I plumetted down onto the cold hard ground.</b></p>	2		20131024102426	690	2		20131024112823	539	1		20131025154614	495	2

I think you should be happy and stay positive to be a circus acrobat. I do my chores every day after school im in 5th grade and get a`s on almost all my work. I dont have a phone so I wont call my family. I have to clean up animal poo almost everyday because I have a dog that poops alot and im the only person that cleans it up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the circus hard or easy I think it would be very hard to get up early and then go to school come home do a perfomence act for everybody then go to bed very late. T hen get up early then it keeps reapting. But I gguess it would be easy if you get up early and go to bed late all the time it would get pretty easy. Do you have lots of fun being and circus acrobat?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My day is like this- first thing i do is get up and get ready for the school bus . Then when im done with school. I go inside and get my homework done. After im done with my homework I go out and do my chores which is my dog,cat ,turtle, fish, rabit. It is not very hard to do all of the animals. Then I go eat a snack and go outside and play. I&nbsp; hope you liked my story I would tell you more, but I got to go.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerly, Jorden</p>	1		20131022205646	545	1		20131023132128	935	1

So I decided to go with the group there were other kids to theat spoke different languages so I had to learn them so I would understand what they were saying. The school that is there is the same that you have, we have report cards and all that kind of stuff. WE also have 30 min. to do whatever we want to do.

After 3 years, at Accel Gymanstics she knew she was ready. She was 17 and was looking for a circus to join. She could just imagine the audience and the flashing lights with the elephants and tightrope. One day, when she was on Burlingame Avenue she saw a ad it was for the circus! She got so excited she told her parents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she told them that she has been dreaming of this moment for 3 years and she thought that it was wonderful. Fortunately, they let her go. As fast as lightning, she went a packed her luggage. It finally came the day of the audition. The man named Jake approved and she was off to the circus. She had to take on lots of pressure and responsibility. After lots of practice the circus came.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There were at least 500 people in the theater. My heart was pounding and my wrists were sweating I was so nervous. I had been waiting for this moment my whole life and here it came. I ran to the rope and jumped high in the sky. It was a marvelous feeling, I heard o's and aw's from the audience. I started going for the tightrope.. I was never good at tightrope I jumped on and danced. I was so proud of myself I wanted to scream! I knew that this is what I have been waiting for 3 years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After the performance, I called home but no one seemed to answer. It seemed odd ,they were always home. When I looked to my right I saw my family. I hugged them and said I missed them but truly I hated to leave home. After a little bit I was off to training in the gym where the circus begins. I thought that the circus was amazing and I will continue doing it for many years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021135709	545	2		20131021155033	935	2		20131022144917	552	2

Circus life is hard and tough, but it can also be very fun and exciting!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, my name is Grace Wilson and I am part of a traveling circus! When i was just 3 years old I began practicing ballet. By the time that I was 12, I was doing ballet, gymnastics, and acrobatics. I worked very hard hoping that one day I could join the circus. By the time I was 15, my dream came true-I worked for a travleng circus!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not anyone can just join the circus. Anyone who wants to join has to have a specific talent, a certain body type, and have determination. The circus isn't all fun and games either. Performers work very hard to get ready for the next show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also some upsides to being in the circus. Performing in a show very exciting and traleving all around the globe is another highpoint. When I first started I didn't want to be so far away from my family, but it was really fun seeing all of the different countries and my family even traveled to places around the globe just to see me perform!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performing in the circus is a very fun and exciting life. I've had tons of fun being an acrobat, juggling and traveling around the world, but I have learned one thing, is you set your mind to it, anything is possible.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023215600	537	2		20131024102637	541	2		20131025141646	495	2

These are some of the things that you could do if you were in the circus. you could ride and elephant or fly through the air. it depends on what your talent is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One day little Suzie went to the circus. She thought it was amazing. When she got home she called her friend. They agreed to start training for the circus.&nbsp; They did gymnastics and then horse back riding.&nbsp; They trained and trained and trained. Until one day when little Suzie got something in the mail. Suzie almost fell over. there if was suzie and her friend were invited to perform in the circus as thier junior act.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She called her friend and they went to the circus. It was really fun but really hard. They weren't going to be home for another 12 MONTHS! that was a really long time. Later that da Suzie decided she did not want to be in the circus anymore. As she started to pack up her stuff her friend walked in and said that she hated it here. Suzie said that she did too they left the circus. Then the ring master found a new pair of kids. &nbsp;</p>	1		20131024113935	562	2		20131024152032	537	1		20131025153133	539	1

It's actually hard to be a circus performer! Many people think it's all fun, games, laughing, and no bad days, but that is not the life of a circus performer. I will show you what the life of a circus performer really is.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I always have to wake up early in the morning. I don't think there was one day in my circus life that I got to have my own day to myself. I always have to hear an annoying alarm everyday! Well, anyways, next thing! I eat breakfast in my pie car and since I'm always with my family, we all have the same schedule, so we always have breakfast together! After that, I get ready and I go into my one-room schoolhouse that travels with us wherever we go! It's fun because my classmates are from different cultures and I learn more! When I'm done with school, I'm already starting chores and training with my father! I'm always improving and trying new things, so it never gets old. Then, I eat dinner with my family, but not too much since I'm performing tonight. When that's done, I go do my shows! Obviously, when show's over, I'm beat and ready to go to sleep! Bad thing is that in 2 days from now I'm already packing up and going to be tired in another place! Now I'm in bed at MIDNIGHT! It sucks, but overall I have fun being in this job and will never stop! Well, maybe.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that was my life! Now you know what a circus performer really does in this world! Hope you think differently! Bye-bye!</p>	2		20131023154803	935	2		20131024085427	562	2

Embarresed, I took a towl from the back and dryed myself off.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When I was&nbsp; playing with my friend's juggling balls they all veered off course and fell on my head. In a fit of anger, I rushed off and slammed the door of my trailer. Then someone tried to pull a prank on me by putting a bucket full of water on my door. Me slamming the door had caused it to fall down and spill on my bed. I was so angry that I did not do anyone of my chores.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then for the finalle of bad things that day, when I was walking on the tightrope with everyone waching me, i fell off!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was truly a very bad, no good, stinking day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	1		20131021153719	690	1		20131022100513	562	2		20131023205203	543	1

We do different kinds of tricks and many shows.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At our circus, some of our many performences include acrobatics and tighgtrope walking. We also work with many animals such as horses, leopards, elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Performing is very fun. If you put your mind to it anything is possible. I started performing when I was 11. Then, I wasn't even close to being perfect but I practiced and practiced. Now instead of only seeing the performences I can do them better than ever.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our circus does ten shows a week. Two on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday and one on the rest of the days.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The circus is always a big job. There is almost no time to sit down and relax. When I come back from school I only have a short break before I have to go back to chores and then practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The circus is a big job and there is a lot going on. There are many animals, tricks, performers which means a lot of practice so it leaves almost no time to relax. No matter what, being in the circus is something you won't regret. You will love everything you do.</p>	2		20131023164428	562	2		20131024094010	556	2		20131025124758	543	2

She couldn't fall on the tightrope, nor fall on the bars triple somersault. Even though that was a burden, Lola LOVED being in the circus. She loved rhythmic gymnastics, playing with animals, and even just training them. It was so fun watching too!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first part of the show came. Lola jumped and did a triple somersault and grabbed onto Harry's ankles, swinging back and forth, then jumped onto the platform on the other side. The circus was fun! She bowed and curtsied as the audience cheered. Then she went offstage to find the elephant trainer. The elephant trainer's cue was when Lola walked over to her. Lola sauntered because there was about two minutes until the elephants actually had to perform. The main elephant could do a trunk-stand!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Even though it was really fun, she still had to eat really fast, get dressed and shower quickly, practice hard, and wake up early. The clown would be juggling and handing out balloons in the crowd. Lola started to talk to Isabelle after she'd finished her part. Then she had to go change for the tightrope part. She was in the middle of changing when the circus master came rushing in and said, &quot;Lola! We're all waiting!&quot; Lola finished changing and zipped out onto the stage. Her dog darted out of the way, letting her pass through as she slowed down to a stop, then walked out&nbsp; on the stage so she didn't look like she was in a big hurry. The circus master sighed with relief as Lola performed well then rushed to change again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After three more hours, the show was over. The crowd was tired. They bought some cotton candy and toys for the children, then went home. Lola was dog tired. She flopped onto her bed and drifted to sleep five minutes later.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next morning, at 7:00 am, Lola's alarm rang again. She zoomed out of bed, grabbed her clothes and toiletry, then rushed to the bathroom. She showered quickly, brushed her teeth, washed her face, and sprinted out of the door to meet her colleagues at the bottom of the stairs. The matinee circus started. While Lola changed, the torch juggler was juggling swords and torches, and riding a unicycle at the same time around and around an elephant. Suddenly Lola heard a big THUMP and heard a cry.</p>	2		20131023215600	537	2		20131024102315	693	2		20131025141646	495	2

My dad is the coordinator of the circus, he arranges everything from designing the graphics for posters to setting up auditions for new performers. I normally don't see him come out of his office in the day, he only comes out at night to see the show and my mom and I. For someone who has to deal with so much and work so often, I'm suprised my dad dosen't get stressed out.My mom is like the nicest person ever, I swear that she is the nicest person anyone could meet. Life at the circus is fun, but really hard.I basically get only 5 hours and 45 minutes of sleep everyday. After that, I go to the pie cart and get my favorties: pancakes,muffins,bacon,fruit, and some milk. Around two hours later, I go to school it's a one room school house, we learn math,writing,reading, and science like any other school. After that I practice for the show with my mom, we do the animal acts. I learn how to train animals, it's really interesting and fun because I really love animals. Finally, after 5 long hours of practice I take a break. I play games on my dad's computer in his office, read books, or play with around with some of the clown's equipment. Last but not least, I eat a little bit and preform in the show I love the cheer of the crowd, the bright lights shining on my face, and just letting all my worries go. Exhaustedly, I drag my self over to the trailer manage to fall asleep. Then after 3 days, we pack up our things and go move to another location. I love the circus, even though it's tough&nbsp; I</p>	1		20131022100314	562	2		20131022123219	690	1		20131023211050	543	1

He was riding on the clown's unicycle, Dave fell and broke the unicycle. He thought he was dead meat, and the show was about to start! An idea popped in hes head. He grabbed the sticky glue and glued the unicycle, by mistake he added glue on the seat. The show was starting, he saw the clown walking by to get his unicycle, so Dave hid behind a barrel. The clown went on stage with the sticky unicycle...Dave yelled and told the clown that the unicycle had sticky gule on the seat, but the clown didn't listen. The clown sat on the unicycle and heard a splat, he tried to get up, but he was stuck on the unicycle. He tried again,but this time he was glued on the unicycle, the crowd gasped at first and then bursted out laughing. The clown ran off the stage, at first he was very mad at Dave, but the clown found out that the crowd loved him...the clown shooked Dave's hands and thanked him.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing Dave did that almost messed up the show was that he forgot to put the animals back in the cage. Dave was looking for the animals everywhere, but he couldn't find them anywhere. He lost the horses,elephants, and even the lions! He thought he was going to be fired, if he can't find the animals. He saw a black and orange stripped cat running away from a brown dog, and he came up with a idea. He went outside with a net, and tried to catch the dog and the cat, but they were too fast. Dave slip, fell, and trip in the mud. Then he went back inside and brought out a toy cat and a dead fish. Daveput the toy cat in the tree... when the dog saw the toy cat, he barked and barked. Dave on the other hand sneaked behind the dog and got him in the net. Then he put the plate of fish on the ground, and waited. Five minutes later he saw the cat eating the fish, then Dave got out from his hiding place and got the cat! He went back inside and sneaked in the dressing room and dressed the dog up into a horse, and dressed the cat in to a lion. All he needed was the elephant, he thought and thought, and he came up with an idea, he was going to buy an elephant from the Zoo... when he got there he saw that the elephants was for free he needed two elephants, there was five elephants left there. People crowed there trying to buy the elephants, but Dave sneaked through the people, the people didn't even notice, they were to busy fighting with the other people. When the Zoo opened, Dave ran and ran... when he got to the the elephants, he asked if he can get them, they said yes. Instead, the Zoo Keepes gave him all five elephants! Dave told the Keepers he only needed two elephants. The Zoo Keepers said &quot;Take it or leave it,&quot; so Dave took all five elephants. When he got back to the circus, The show was starting... during the show, Dave was wishing that the show was going to be a hit, and it did! Everybody laugh and laugh! &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final thing Dave did wrong was that, he forgot to wash the dusty, old, dirty bicycles, he was to busy sleeping. Someone yelled that the show was about start in five minutes, Dave woked up and got soap, rags, and a bucket of water, he thought he can't wash all ten bicycles! So, he gave it a shot, when he was done with one bicycle, it took him three minutes! He had two minutes left! He looked around and around, and saw a hose and a bunkey of yellow/gold paint, he thought that it would only take a minute to paint the bicycles with a hose...he poured the bucket of paint in the hose,and turned it on. It sprayed and sprayed, the bicycles was all painted, it took less then a minute! Dave heard the speakers said &quot;Show will be starting in 10...9...8...,&quot; Dave saw people coming to get their bicycles, Dave thought that the paint was still wet... the people grabbed the wet, painted bicycles, Dave tried to stop them it was no use... He heard the speakers again &quot;3...2...1... Show is now starting,&quot; the people rode on stage with the wet bicycles. When the show was over, the people got up to bow, and turned around... The crowd laugh so hard they almost fell off their seats! The people was so shy, that they ran of stage as a puff a smoke. After the show, the crowd said &quot;This is the best circus in the wrold that I have ever gone too!&quot;and some even said &quot;I am coming here everyday from now and on!&quot; The people who worked at the circus, thanked Dave, and told him to stay and work at the circus. But Dave who was tired, said thanks and when back home... when he got home, he went right to bed, and said &quot;Best day ever!&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, when your working at the circus, you have to work. You might not always play games or have fun like Dave,who almost messed up the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023112547	539	2		20131023131652	693	2

Another act is the tightrope walker. That is fun but it is also very very dangerous because you can fall and miss the safe place to land on. Another fun act is the juggler because you supprise the crowd. It s also dangerous because sometimes you can juggle things like saws or knives and thosse things can fall on your head and you can get injered. The clown is nice to but people realy make fun of you but dont be offended by them just belive in yourself. A differant thing to do is totrain the circus horses and make &nbsp; learn new tricks &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do thosse acts you must have talent and you also have to belive in your self. Dont change just because of what people say about you. You also cant just&nbsp; when you dont feel good or when you just want to give up because hear we are all family and family cant split up.Now you can see that becoming a circus actor isnt easy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The big day is hear now today we all must set up everything for the show. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We must pratice for the show or else we will be a big diapointment to the host and we will be a big embaressment.

I thought the only &quot;cool&quot; animal thing would be a bicycling bear but there is also a lion tamer and painting elephants.After this visit the circus was a whole lot different to me. This circus was a very amusing one to. The lighting was nice and the special effects.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I thought about the animal acts are either, the elephants, the lion tamer, and the uni-cycling bear! Even though I thought a bear would be thought to us a tricycle it turns out they train it to use a<b> </b></p> <p><u><b>unicycle </b></u>which to me is about a thousand times harder! I really liked the elephants because they taught them how to paint!!! and the art was only stick figures but especially because the used their trunks!!! I also thought the lion tamer was cool because he put his head in the lions mouth and the lion didn't chomp his head off!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; What I thought about my favorite acts without animals was the trapeze, tightrope, sword swallower, and the really flexible guys.</p> <p>I thought the sword swallower was <b><u>amazing</u></b><u> </u>because swallowing swords is so hard because it goes down the throat without cutting themselves!!! Also those really flexible guys are really crazy because 4 of them can fit in a small box and still fit with the lid closed!!! what I thought about tight rope was that they actually use a uni cycle holding a large stick with 2 people on his shoulders and going across a really thin rope!! And the trapeze was really cool because they swing rope to rope like how monkeys swing vine to vine but they also do flips and sumersualts to!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I sort of liked the clowns even though they dress wierd they were pretty funny becuse they throw creme pie at each other and they squirt water out of flowers. But I dony really liked it becuase i thought clowns were acting a bit to over reactive but like 10 clowns can fit in a tiny car. But I also like the juggling becuase they juggle like, 10 balls!!! They even juggled knives which to me is pretty risky.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; But I thought the knife throwers were really cool becuase they have someone spinning on a wheel and throw knives around him. Also, the knives go just between the legs and sometimes pinning the clothes but missing the body! The acrobats are also cool becuase its like the trapeze but they do flips and they also jump and grab a rope then jumps and grabs someones hand and they jump around doing backflips and stuff. The acrobats are a lot like the trapeze but with partners. The acrobats are also really light becuase whan they land you can hear only a little of them becuase they are pretty light.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Finally, I thought&nbsp; the finale was cool becuase they were standing on top of each other and balncing an a ball! There were people and a seal! It was cool becuase they were making a castle by standing on top of each other. And people were standing on the shoulders. That was pretty cool because it fell withoout anyone getting hurt!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; That was my favorite things at my first visit at a circus. It has never been so cool until now. Before I thought it would have no that many stuff, but I found a whole lot more intersesting things thats what I thought about the circus. I now like the circus better than before! I hope you enjoyed!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021133217	562	1		20131021155328	545	2		20131022111032	552	1

My name is Clarissa. I'm a circus performer. The circus I work for is the <b>CIRCUS!CIRCUS! </b>place in Las Vegas, Nevada The way you see the circus is pretty funny and humorous. The thing you don't know is that under all those suits and makeup, is a <b>LOT</b> of hard work. Yup, that's right, <b>WORK.</b> When you're in the circus, you have lots of fun watching, but the question is, &quot; How do they do all those performances? &quot; Well, let me show you my point of view.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b><u>Getting Into Shape</u></b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I'll tell you how I trained to do my job, being an acrobat. As you can see, you have to be very flexible. When, I first started my circus career, I wasn't as stretchy as I am now. That's because they told me that I wasn't really in good shape. I have to admit, I wasn't that athletic until now because they took me to a gymnastics class. My gymnastics class was held at a special circus training area in Vegas. In gymnastics, they trained me to become as flexible as an octopus. They also trained me how to be balanced and concentrated, too. That's how I'm able to do as many flips as I can, jump, and land on those elephants with my other acrobats. After taking that class 8 hours each day, I became one of the most flexible acrobats in the circus. All in all, that's already a lot of work just to get myself in shape. Now, here's the REAL deal.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b><u>Acrobat Routines</u></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all performers in the world, we have <b><b>routines.</b></b> A routine is a type performance that requires lots of practice, determination, and talent, such as doing a dance, or a cheerleading. My routine as an acrobat sounds really easy if you watch, but very hard if you know what to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the acrobat routines, most of the time, you'd see people make pyramids and stuff like that. What others do is nothing compared to my most favorite routine. First, we hang on a tight rope and make a long ladder by hanging on to each other. Next, we climb down the human rope and we each get a normal-sized red, bouncy ball. Using our balance and concentration, we step on to the ball, and flip on to our hands. It sounds fun, but it's not easy. Then, we roll ourselves by a gigantic, red, porcelain ball and carefully flip back onto our feet. After we do that, we jump onto the ball and hold each others' hands. We then do a hand stand, link legs, and we're finished! Right after the audience applauses, we let go, slide of, and bow, and of course, we do these routines at CIRCUS!CIRCUS!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The really difficult thing about this is that we practice our routine almost 24/7, until our next performance. Another thing to worry about is that we have a performance almost every 3 days, twelve hours, for 7 months. As I repeat, it's not easy being a circus performer. Oh yeah, let me tell you what we acrobats get to wear!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b><u>Crazy for Clothes</u></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, you know that acrobats can't use their pajamas as a costume. It would be really silly. Yes, I know that a circus would be all about silly, but in the circus world, it would kind of be considered improper. The acrobats' costumes are spandex coveralls with polka dots. The girls get a tutu &amp; silly cap included. On the other hand, the boys get a spiral slinky belt and a pointy cap.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really crazy about this because it's not like you can get these anywhere! Circus costumes are made especially for circus performers <b>ONLY</b>. We get our special costumes made by the ringmaster's special business.&nbsp; That means they are very rare in the world. Although, it's not like we where these in practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In practice sessions, we wear spandex footed tights and a spandex t-shirt. It's very similar to what we wear during shows and mantinees, but simple. Now you see why it's very difficult to be an acrobat because spandex can slip off a polished, porcelain ball easily. Also, I'll bet you're wondering why we wear spandex. Acrobats use it because it's easier to stretch and use our flexibility. That's what we acrobats get to wear.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you see, living a life as an acrobat isn't easy. There are difficulties, billions of practice runs, shows and mantinees, and LOTS of hard work. Being a performer requires talent, determination, the right body, and confidence. If you can complete those tasks, you're ready to go! But don't forget, it's not easy at the circus!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022210720	537	2		20131023133152	562	2		20131024115504	552	2

I WILL GIVE YOU ALL A BREIF LOOK OF MY LIFE AT THE CIRCUS. MY LIFE IS VERY HARD. MY WORK AMUSES CHILDREN, AND MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID AGAIN. EVERY SHOW THAT I PUT ON FEELS GREAT. I FEEL AS IF I WAS A PART OF A BIG FAMILY. WHEN YOU JOIN A CIRCUS YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW, THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS WELCOME YOU NICELY, BUT IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE A GREAT TALENT THAT MAY IMPRESS THEM, THEY WILL ACCEPT YOU. WHEN YOU JOIN A CIRCUS, IT IS LIKE JOINING ONTO A LEGACY. WHEN YOU HAVE JOINED INTO A CIRCUS YOU WILL FEEL LIKE THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING YOU BACK. I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE WORKING IN A CIRCUS BECAUSE OF MY FEAR OF CLOWNS, BUT I GOT OVER IT. MY FEAR OF CLOWNS ENDED AFTER I MADE FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CLOWN SUITS. THE REASDON THAT I HAD A VERY BAD FEAR OF CLOWNS IS BECAUSE OF A SHOW THAT I WATCHED AS A YOUNG CHILD. ONE OF THE SHOWS THAT I USED TO WATCHED WAS A SHOW CALLED SUPERNATURAL. IT WAS A VERY CREEPY SHOW. THIS SHOW SHOWED CLOWNS THE CLOWNS THOUGH WERE KILLERS. THE CLOWNS WERE ALL NOT KILLERS I NOW KNOW THAT AFTER MEETING ONE OF THEM. I AM NOW A CUTORTINATIST I CAN BEND MY BODY IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. THIS IS MY JOB, THAT IS MY ACT.

My job was with the Lions, Bears, Monkeys, and Elephants. I was a very talented girl. I was 10 when I had tried out. Before, I was the girl who danced before it started and after it was over. Then they moved me over just with the Monkeys for 6 months. Then they moved me with the Monkeys and the Elephants for another 6 months. They noticed I was very talented and was working hard so they moved me to the Lions and Bears.</p> <p>They had try outs so a 7 year old girl made it, her name was Valerie. She was talented, but needed alittle help so she was my assisant&nbsp; for 7 months. In thoughs 7 months she was moved into Lions and Bears.Then I was moved to Tigers and&nbsp; Chimpanzes.A few months later she was moved to Monkeys and Elephants. She didn't appear for the 3 shows.

Let me tell you some are and some aren't. My name is Bob Evens I am a clown. I travel 20,000 miles, I go to around 150 city's. We work form sunup to sundown. The circus life is good.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to know what my schedule is? Here it is, At 7:00 A.M. I wake up get dressed,and go to the pie car to get some breakfast.While the crew sets up the tent, lights and music for tonight's show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 9:00 A.M. it's school time. The one room school house travels with us. It has computers, test, and report cards. Some of the circus performers are from other country's&nbsp; they speak different languages. In the circus our geography lesson comes to life.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:00 P.M. school lets out. We get a quick break. We play with some of&nbsp; circus toys. I play with the baby leppords. I shot spit balls at the lions. I give the elephants peanuts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:30 I put on my make up and practice my tricks like the others. Somtimes I feed, water, and groom the horses. The trainers train some of the animals. Somtimes goff of for practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6:30 P.M. it's dinner time. I normaly don't eat much. some of the people eat enough to fill a elephants stomach. their belly normally hurts after the show. If I mess up my make up I have to redo it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 P.M. The shows over we go to bed that night. most people go right to sleep I don't. I love my circus life!</p>	2		20131023130336	541	2		20131023165655	562	2

Do you ever think people in circuses have a nice relaxing life with tons of fun and play? Well life is not like that. My name is Darwin and I work at a circus. I have to work for more than 12 hours a day!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Working at a circus is hard work. I must train for a few hours and perform in front of a live crowd. If one person is injured, the whole event is ruined, and everyone will feel ashamed. There are many consequences of not practicing well, so we need to train for many hours.In a circus, we still have school and other programs. We live in trailers and we learn things like other students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Even though circus life is hard, it is a fun job that we still like.</p>	2		20131022103048	539	2		20131022114127	545	2

Many kids in the class come from all over the world and they speak a different language so sometimes it is a little tricky to understand them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3:00 pm is when school gets out. The clowns let me play with the unicycles and juggling balls. It's alot of fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3:30 PM I do my chores and practice my act. I feed, water, and groom the horses we use in the act. Today my dad has to practice summersaulting off of a running horse. I am a little bit nervous for him but I'm sure he will be okay. I practice leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back, it takes balance and focus to do it. Other kids my age are practicing juggling and acrobatics. My neighbor takes baby leopards out for walks. Trainers work with elephants, lions, and monkeys for the show that is coming up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>6:30 pm time for dinner, I'm starving! my family and I head out for the pie car for dinner, but we are sure not to eat too much before the show. We do ten shows a week. One on each weekday, in addition to the manitee on Wednsday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>10:30 pm the show is over and I am SUPER tired! We go back to our trailer and pass the circus ofices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. In two days we will be in a totally different town.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>12:00 am I'm in bed and thinking about the end of our touring season. It will be great to get back to my real home in Florida. Then I wonder if I will still be in the circus when grow up. I have no idea what I am going to be because i am just a kid. The circus is really fun and exciting, but sure is a lot of work.</p>	N		20131024105518	77		N	20131024110018	543		N

You've probably never heard of the town I live in because, well, it's tiny. In fact the population is only 382 people. If you really want to know the name, it's Bakshea. Brazil has been split into different color districts. Each color district has two or three small towns in it. The six color districts are, The Green District, the Red District, the Blue District, the Yellow District, the Purple District, and the Orange District.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My mom&nbsp; asked me to go to Shealey, the next closest town to us, where all the shops were, for bread, milk, butter,cheese, and cloth for the next two weeks.I left home at sunrise, even though I was about to fall asleep just talking to my mom. I walked the two miles to Shealey, bored out of my mind. Once I got to Shealey I walked into the Bakery. There wasn't much to gawk over since the baker didn't have a glass counter to put treats in, but he did have a plastic case for a cake. The cake that was in the case was a strawberry cake with chocolate icing and strawberries to decorate the top. <b>&quot;How could anyone afford this cake?&quot;</b> I thought. I ringed the bell on the cold stone counter. After a few seconds a bald plump man with a dirty white coat came up to the counter. &quot;Hi Mr.Trumpers,&quot; I said.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hello Dellak. Do you want the usual?&quot; Mr.&nbsp; Trumpers asked.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yep. Three loafs of bread,&quot; I answered.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Okay. Hold on a minute.&quot; Mr. Trumpers replied.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I waited for Mr. Trumpers to bring me the bread, I thought, &quot;<b>I wonder if Mr. Trumpers has any children.</b>&quot; I decided to ask. Mr. Trumpers walked back into the room and I thanked him for the bread, payed him and asked, &quot;Mr. Trumpers do you have any children?&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, why'd you ask?&quot; Mr. Trumpers replied</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't know, I guess I just wanted to meet someone new,&quot; was my answer.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left the Bakery and headed for the Dairy Farm. The walk wasn't bad since it was only two blocks away. When I got to the Dairy Farm's lobby I saw a sign that said <b>Win front row seats at the Bellini</b> <b>C</b><b>ircus!</b> I thought,&quot;<b>The Bellini Circus! In the small town of Shealey! I can't believe it! But it would be so expensive. I have to win this contest!</b>&quot; I walked in to see Rosy, the farmer's daughter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Can I help you?&quot; Rosy asked.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes. I'd like four pitchers of milk, with lids, in a container, two sticks of butter, and two wheels of cheese, please,&quot; I said trying to sound polite not rood and pushy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Okay, Dellak. I'll go get that for you,&quot; she replied.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was almost out the door when I shouted after her, &quot;Oh and, Rosy, how do you enter the contest for front row seats to the&nbsp; Bellini Circus?&quot;.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned around and walked over to the counter. Then she answered my question, &quot;You write a story that takes place in a circus and turn it in to me by May 28th.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&quot;Today's April 29th so I have a little less than a month,&quot;</b> I thought. &quot;Okay, thanks Rosy.&quot; I said calmly even though inside my heart was pounding so hard it was a bomb's timer counting down until it explodes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Your welcome. Now let me go get your stuff,&quot; she said sharply, but also being goofy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; I said, which made her giggle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Rosy gave my my things I paid her and left. I went to the fabric shop got the cloth my mom wanted and headed home, never stopping thinking about the story I was going to write.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time I got home it was clearly afternoon. I walked inside helped my mom put away the groceries, and ran strait to my room to start writing my story. It was harder than I thought it would be. I had only gone to a circus once, and it was a long time ago. I could remember that there were men and women with painted faces and big red noses. There were also lions, tigers, and bears. Another thing I can remember is that there were people that rode a bicycle with only one wheel on a rope really high up in the air and people who swung on bars and did tricks up in the air.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I ended up writing the winning story. I title it The Mysterious Trip of a Lifetime.</p>	2		20131023162503	562	2		20131023200947	539	2

My parents grew up in the circus too. My mom's a trapeze artist, and my dad is a juggler. We get to travel all around the world. I go to over 150 cities per year! The whole circus is like my family.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus isn't always that fun though. The shows are long, and some tricks are hard to do. I miss my home in California a lot. I don't have a regular home. I'm always moving around. I never see my family except for my mom and dad. I don't even have the weekends off.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My daily schedule starts off with school. I wake up at 7:00 AM and go to the pie car to eat. At 9:00 AM school starts. It's like any other school, but my classmates come fro all around the world. They all speak different languages, like, French, Russian, Italian, and English like me. 3:00 PM, I take a quick break. At 3:30 PM I do my chores. I feed and water my horses, Belle and Jack. I use them in some of the circus's acts. Then I practice for the show. I always wanted to join a sports team but I've never had the opportunity. At 6:00 PM I have dinner. It's very light though because we're about to preform. I do 10 shows a week. At 10:00 the show is over, I'm very tired.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus is very fun, but it is also very busy and tiring.&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113951	556	2		20131024144656	541	2

I am nervous but I know I can go across the tight rope which is 60 feet off the ground. I have gone across it before but this time, my father told me to make a twist to the act and wants me to go across the tight rope while doing the hula hoop. Even though I practiced walking on the tight rope while hula hooping, I am scared because the whole circus is depending on me. Only if the European promoter is pleased with our show, our circus will be able to go on a world tour to Europe.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I slowly take step by step on the tight rope and began to hula</p> <p>hoop. I close my eyes and think about how I will feel when the European promoter promotes us. I made it across the tight rope! The crowd cheers as I climb down the ladder. I walk back into my dressing room with joy and nervousness. I can hear the promoter talking to my father, the manager of the circus. When I hear the promoters foot steps as he leaves back stage my father knocks on my door and tells me that the promoter loved out circus act and promoted us to the Europe world tour. I do a cart wheel with joy. I help my dad pack our stuff because tomorrow we have a long drive to Europe.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning the whole circus loaded their stuff into the bus and we all ride on the bus for seven whole hours. Even though I am bored, I am excited about my first performance in Europe. When we arrive at our designated place, I help to set up the tents. Since we finished setting everything up earlier than we planned my dad says I can go and explore the city.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come back at seven o'clock, right before show time. I dress up and hurry to my spot on the tight rope. I easily make it across the first time. The crowd cheers and wants me to go across again on the tight rope but this time with two hula hoops. I ask my dad what to do and he says I should give it a try so I do. I almost make it across the tight rope when I loose my balance and fall off. I fainted. When I woke up, I was in a hospital. My dad came up to the bed I was laying in and told me what happened. I had broken my neck and leg. My dad told me that I had undergone a surgery and turns out I will not be able to perform ever again. I was so disappointed that I started crying.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went back to the circus and after a few days I got over the fact that I cannot do the thing I love most, perform.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022164645	693	2		20131023132240	690	2		20131025100322	539	2

Even if you are one you can practice than you can become a better circus performer. Anyways, In a circus you can choose a job that you want to do. For example, you can be a Acrobat or a juggler but if you choose these jobs just remember practice will make you to victory. Many people have to practice a lot like a tough job for example leaping on a trampoline onto a horseback. It takes balance and you have to put effort into the work many of you people do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now lets talk about how to become a circus performer. If you&nbsp;</p> <p>want to be a circus performer you have to do step by step to get victory. alright lets get started. First, you have to have good body type and a specific talent. If you are a juggler, You need have good talent because the balls that you are going to juggle cannot fall down and you need to have good body structure also. Do you know wwhy?&nbsp; The body type can determine how good or style you have and how fell you are doing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now lets talk about the things you do in a circus. You will have</p> <p>some chores to do like grooming the horses and practicing somersaults like want I do to practice and to perform well in front of the audience or everybody. And so you see that circus is hard life and plus on the other hand you get to go to many places or have fun.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113940	562	2		20131024143900	539	1		20131025160327	552	2

That morning something unexplainable happened!

When they said thank you and I left I was so ancious to see if I was hired.

In my oppinion I recomend you to stand back away from the wild animals because some animals are not treaned,but if you want to get a closer look you may. <br>First of all, I would want to tell you many performers travel all around the world . they are very bussy and they are nonstop. Also all performers speak different languages not all of them are the same. The preformers have to wake up early.They have to wake up like around 7:00am. Being a preformer I can tell its hard work. They have to practice all day long.	1		20131024113907	537	0		20131024142504	562	1		20131025151733	543	1

In this story, you will learn about what it's like to be a circus performer as a young person. it's a hard, rough, and exhausting life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Marlla Mandora was an active and performing loving 12 year old girl. she was never shy and loved to perform anywhere anytime. She was a dancer, performed ballet, and even musical gymnastics. She would enter every talent show she could and anything she was good at.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Marlla's parents were proud of their daughter. They supported her in anyway they could. &quot;When I get older, I wanna join the circus! Oh how fun it would be doing acrobatics and swinging from high! It would be a dream!&quot; she said to her mother. Like I said, her parents supported her in anyway she could.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When Marlla was 18, her parents signed her up for circus tryouts. Marlla knew it was gonna be hard. There were many people trying out. Some breathed fire. Some juggled chainsaws. Some even did funny acts! but only few were chosen. And one of them was me!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Marlla was happy and sad at the same time. Marlla got her dream but she had to leave her supporting parents. But her parents knew that their little girl had to leave. With that, a circus member took Marlla and gave her a tour of people and animals and equipment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At 10:00 P.M., there was a show. But Marlla wasn't in it. She had to watch to see how the showed worked. Marlla was thrilled at the stunts and funny tricks. She couldn't wait for her first show! She especially loved the stunts on horseback.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Marlla woke up a 7 in the morning and went to the pie cart and had breakfast. She asked the animal keeper if she could help with anything. the keeper said yes and gave her a job with the horses. She groomed and fed them and mucked out their stalls.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Something excited is happening today. Today will be Marlla's first show! Marlla was doing acrobatics. She was very excited. But first, they had to setup the Big Top Tent and then a bunch of others. it was hard work setting up all the tents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>By the end of the day, Marlla was wiped out. She was so exhausted. But then she had to help put down all the tents and put away the animals and give them their dinners and fix their beds. Then Marlla got to finally sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next day, it all happened again. Marlla performed and loved it but it was too much work everyday, having to perform 10 times a week with four shows on the weekend. She missed going home to her parents and performing for them once in a while.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She decided to quit and go back to her home in Alabama. She surprised her parents by returning without them knowing. &quot;What. Why are you here?&quot; her parents asked, &quot;Oh, it was too hard too keep up with all the shows and taking tents down and taking care of the animals,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With that, she lived with her parents and still performed.She eventually found a husband and had two children. She inspired her children to act and surprisingly...her children became movie stars!</p>	2		20131024113935	562	2		20131024151806	690	2

At 8:30 you have to go do chores and after that rehearse. I rehearse till two hours before the show. The show starts at 3:00 and ends at 6:00. I am exhausted after the show.

I am a performer in the circus. My act is lion taming. It looks easy but actually it is very hard and a bit scary. First of all, you always have to have pure concentration because if something goes wrong, you will be a lions dinner for sure. When you are up there with the lions,always remember not to get on their bad side. Other then that,it is not that stressful. As I always say, become one with the lions. Let hem understand that you are their friend.</p> <p>Over the years, have become very close to these big cats. in fact now all the guys at the circus call me the lion whisperer because I have this connection with them. I sometimes go in their cages and fool around with them. I sit with them while they sleep next to me or lick my face. To me, honesly their just a bunch of house cats. Big house cats. I like to hear them purr when I stroke them and brush their wild manes. If you feel like I do, like you feel like you connect with lions, dont be so sure that you feel like you can just walk right into a lion cage and expect them to be all friendly. Actually,in my case, it was not love at first sight. I remember when I first walked into the cage. The biggest male lion,Muzala, growled at me and bared his teeth. Afterwards, I kept my distance and was patient. Now they are like my cats. I love my job and intend to keep doing it for as long as I live.</p>	2		20131023213454	545	2		20131024091230	562	2		20131025134059	543	2

I, Carry Smith know what its like being in the circus. I live with my family in a circus trailer. We travel around the world almost every year. And over 200 different citys every year, maybe even more then that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly likely a day for me:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:00 A.M. I wake up, Take a shower, Get dressed. And go to a gastation or nearby food truck for breakfast alot of times bacon and pancakes. Then help the circus crew get set for the show for tonight.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:30 A.M. Time for school:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many different things then in a regular school like yours. Many people in my class speake different languages like german,french,and italian. My family only speakes french,german and english. As we travel around the world every different lesson seems to comes to life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; 4:15 P.M. School is over:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for a quick snack and a break from school until tomorrow. The trapeze artist let me play on the trapezes. Also the clowns let me play with there clown cars and juggle. I also play with the tiger, Cuddles. I want to play on a cheerleading team but, we never stay long in one place for me to play a sport.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; 4:30 P.M.&nbsp; Practice:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; My dad and I feed,water and groom the tigers and horses.We use in the tiger act and horse act. Today, my mom practices taming the tigers more I help her it is sometimes really scary. I'm also working on doing a horse back trick.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; 5:15 P.M. dinner time:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My family and I usually go to a resturant to eat some a gas station if we cant find a resturant.We dont eat very much before the show that happening tonight anyway. We do 8 shows a week. one each week day and a special one on Saturday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:45 P.M. Show is over:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I'm wiped out. We walk back to the circus trailer, We stop at the concession stands sometimes. But, we really pass the other stuff like the stables,circus offices, and other trailers. Now when I'm asleep we'll be in a different town tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:45 P.M. In bed:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; im thinking about the end of this season of touring. The circus is fun and all But, I miss my ranch in South Carolina. When I grow up, I think I'll still be a circus performer. The circus is fun but, it's not so easy as a life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022120003	693	2		20131022134114	539	1		20131024102811	552	1

There are upsides and downsides to the afternoon but its all worth it.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After school you will have to rehearse with the animals and feed them. Doing this will help prepare them for the performance. When you finish practicing with an animal you will have to move on to a different animal so this might take some time. While you're practicing with them you will also be learning more yourself. When you have finished rehearsing with all of the animals you will need to practice your own routine. You might think that this sounds silly but&nbsp; you do need your practice too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are finished practicing with the animals and yourself, you will need to get ready&nbsp; for your performance. You will also need to eat but do not eat such a big meal before your performance because depending on what you are doing you do not want stomach cramps.&nbsp; After the performance you are wipped out so it is time for bed and boy will you be tired in the morning!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a circus performer is tough but it is all worth it if you are having fun and doing what you love. If you do want to become a circus performer I reccomend you&nbsp; stick to your mind and try your best.</p>	1		20131024113924	541	1		20131024140601	935	1

Anyone can join th circus but you have to work at it. To be in the circus is fun but not evey thing is all fun and games somethins you have to take serious. Like when you are on the tight rope you have to make sure that you stay balence. The circus is almost like gymnastics. When you are balencing on the tight rope it is like balencing on the balence beem. Or when you are making flipping over stuff it is like doing flips on the bar in gymnastics. I li ke doing gymnastics because it is fun and amazing. I hope you think that the circus and gymnastics are amazing&nbsp; and fun too. That is why I want to be in the circus on of these days when I grow up to be older. And Ithink you should want to be ain the circus too. And if you do I hope you go for it and have fun.I think that everybody should try to chase there dream no matter what people say.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END</p>	1		20131022165337	562	1		20131023090228	541	1

One adult was putting fire into his mouth it was creepy. After a wild afternoon it was time for the real thing.The circus was starting, our family got the front row tickets and got the coolest view talking about lucky&nbsp; the show was starting it started with a lion jumping through firing hoop an a woman was balancing up high with sharks below her I was afraid she was going to fall but she didn't and she also did a really cool back flip while balancing talking about entertainment so the show went on with elephants, tigers, and mouses who you may think can't do anything but if you were at that circus you would be really surprised. So we returned home and happy.????</p>	1		20131022115032	539	1		20131022162601	693	1

Well, you had come to the right place I will talk about the animals, people,and when they get ready. Then what they do? how long they work? So that what I will talk about and answer the question.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing I will talk about is the Circus acrobats. They are the hardest worker they fly in the air, and a rope hold them on to them and they practice every day, and the boy have to hold the girl with his two bare hands! But sometime biting on the chain and the girl too they can hold on. Then sometime they have to do flips and they have to hold stuff sometime and hold the person, and they wear pretty cloths. Then they work hard Intel the grand opening so they practice every day and sometime breaks and that why they work hard. So they work hard, what they do,&nbsp; they work hard,and some breaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next one is the horses. They work hard too the person that train them have to be very good and train the horses but sometime the horses don't listen sometime and miss up and they have to practice what they miss up and practice a lot. They are real good,after so that is hard training. They work hard and they practice every day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actors are good and they have in side the circus their are games and fun activity's and the performers practice long days and sometime spend time at home. They are hard working and never stop or give up. Being accountant,but there are some drawback.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They get ready for the show they get the performers ready in place and everyone can get in. So the show get ready so they inter-dos the show to the people but, when the clowns come in some baby get scared of them because there makeup and style and there laughter. So that how they get ready.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing when they get ready the first thing is:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp; <b>P</b>ie car: where circus performers eat so they won't get hungry when they do the play or show</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.)&nbsp; <b>U</b>nicycles: a bicycle with one wheel so the clown or juggler gets on</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.)&nbsp; <b>G</b>room: clean and brush so they can look good</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.)&nbsp; <b>M</b>atinee: afternoon show that when they are doing their play</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.)&nbsp; <b>W</b>ipe <b>O</b>ut: very tired that when they are ready to leave the circus</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion the circus was fun and I talk about what they are and when there break and plans and get ready so it is hard to be in the circus is tough. You try your best and there are line by line never stop. Then you spend time with your family when you are do from the circus and you can be together so that's all about the circus and it is fun there so see you at the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	0		20131022210947	537	0		20131023103929	562	0		20131025090152	539	0

It takes a lot of practice, talent, and work. In fact, much of the life in the big top is working and practicing. Here is what a day would be like if I were a circus performer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I would start off the day by waking up, getting dressed, and going to the pie car, the place where circus performers eat. If I have time, I would go help the performers set up for tonight's show. Next I would go to the schoolhouse car. So, if you think circus life is all play and no work, you still have to go to school. After school, I get a short break, but after that, it's chores, chores, chores, and time for practice, practice, and more practice. Next, it is time for the show. I must do my act, which could be tightrope walking, juggling, lion taming, or even being a human cannonball. The show would last for hours, but after that it's time to rest and sleep. This same schedule would last every day. As you can see, circus life can be tough, yet it's all worth it in the end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>However, before you even step into this wild life, you must become a circus performer. You must have talent and determination. Sure, you get to travel the world, but it could be months or even years before you see your family. There are also many people in this world, so don't get your hopes up about joining. However, if you have a special talent, like being flexible, super strong, or fast, you would be a great candidate. In short, preparing for circus life is just as exciting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;In conclusion, there are ups and downs to performing in the circus. A day for a performer is hectic, yet amusing. It takes a lot to get in the circus, but it is most definitely worth it. The circus, from my point of view, is a tough profession, with fun and work all in one.</p>	2		20131023213845	545	2		20131024092629	562	2		20131025143918	552	2

AND that trick was me throwing six creme pie's in my partner's face the crowd was howling with laughter. The circus was so great we became#1 circus in town.

It`s a big day today. We have three performances to go to&quot;, my mom said. &quot;All right&quot;, I yelled back. Your probaley thinking what does she mean by performances? Well I work at a circus. Now, let me tell you one thing it`s not that easy. First you got to have a talent for something to be in a circus. You also should start young so you can build up your learning so when you get older you`ll know a lot about circus see I started when I was five, now I`m twelve. That`s seven years of being in the circus and I`ve learned a lot.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now let me tell you about the bad parts of being in a circus. You`ll have to travel to a lot of places and by the end of the day you`ll be beat because you traveled to so many places in one day. Believe me it`s tiring. Sometimes there could be at least four performances in one day that you have to go to.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So in the end I recomend you to join the circus because it`s a lot of fun, but there are some faults about the circus. So I`m off to my first permormance of the day!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022162601	693	2		20131023085443	541	2		20131024132636	552	2

At a circus &nbsp;jugglers&nbsp;can juggle fire and &nbsp;knives.

Cameras flashed. Klaus was confused as he woke. He thought he had messed up. The rips on his shirt, his broken bones and the unconscious heap of the clown&nbsp; proved it. Yet they were cheering. Suddenly realization dawned on him as he saw the pistol in now officialy sociopathic Tennyson's limp grasp and the braying horse next to his body with his startled Father on it, the reigns tight in his hands...</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air was tense in the tent. This would be Klaus's first big act with the Giavanni circus, and it was odvious the other performers doubted his aptitude to perform. Especially Tennyson. Tennyson had been a limber clown when he started, so it was said, but after years of eating in the pie car and lying on the train's cozy couch, a potbelly had protruded and now all that was left of his formerly skinney self was the thin face that resided under the wig he wore. Rumor was that he was bald, but this was yet to be proven due to his never removing his fake purple curls, even when asleep. Tennyson also was growing increasingly jealous of Klaus's father, who led the circus, because he thought he was the rightful leader. Under Tennyson's sneer, he emerged from the tent and out onto the ring, feeling genuinly worried. Here I go, thought Klaus as Father emerged on horseback for their act.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klaus's act was going reasonably well. Their act was simple, but hard. Clowns would be juggling around the ring, and inside it Father would be riding around the ring, going clockwise. In the center, on a trampoline, Klaus would be doing flips, cartwheels, and other tricks until Father rode around the ring for the sixth time. On the sixth round, Klaus would backflip off the trampoline and onto the horse and land standing. They were now on the fith rotation, and Klaus could feel his heart rate increase. He had done well enouph to recieve roars of aproval from the audience after each trick, but now he was only faintly hearing all background noise. <b>Clip clop, clip clop</b> went the hoove beats on the ground, as the horse was nearing the end of its sixth time around. <b>Boom Boom, Boom Boom, </b>went his heart, which was now in his throat. He bounced, his legs went over his head, and...</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klaus heard bones crack as he hit the recipiant of his leap.

Bring all your friends we'll have food and candy for <b>everybody</b>. The opening starts on this 20th. The circus will have: funny clowns, circus animals, and other fun circus material.<br> <br> This is where I work at the circus it's not that fun since i'm the trash boy. Of course you might already know that a trash boy always picks up trash around the circus. that is true but my story is different. You see I was an orphan and I got adopted by a circus man named Tod. he is now my dad but he is no longer with me. He died off just like my regular family did&nbsp; didn't know what happened to them. That's when I began working at the circus. The circus is like a family to me a family that picks on me of course. I'm more of the feeling type. I know how people feel alot and try to be friends with them but I don't have any.<br> <br> I always think of escaping but something deep inside me just makes me stay. I always wanted to be a juggler but the downside is I don't know how to juggle. So today is the day I ask to be a juggler. It's 12:00PM I go to the manager's office and I tell him. He said &quot;I'm sorry Sammy someone has to be the trash boy.&quot; then at that moment a miracle happened someone came in the office and asked to be the trash boy. So from this that on I was a circus juggler.</p>	2		20131022120002	693	1		20131022152632	562	2		20131023211050	543	2

With lots of new people inside that world.You can see typical circus animals,acts,and people&nbsp; such as clowns,lions,trapeze artists,tight-roping, and more. Some Circuses are amazing like <b><b>Cirque du Soleil</b>. </b>People from all over the world come to see circuses when they come into town.&nbsp; People from all over the world also participate in the circus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH, AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH fill the circus tents. Everyone is amazed on daring, incredible tricks everything can seem like an illusion in the circus tents. Elephants seals, lions zebras ,cheetahs a lot of unordinary zoo animals all participate in the amazing show. Five clowns in one small car?! AMAZING! A man diving into a small pool thirty-five feet high?! INCREDIBLE! A man tight-roping from the top of the tent?! NERVE - RACKING!!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being in the circus isn't all fun and games for the performers. Most of the time they practice almost nonstop.They do this because in a show you need to know exactly what you are doing. If you aren't practicing you will typically be doing things like what you do at home...chores. Everyone has a job to do. Whether it's grooming the show horses, or setting up the tent , people will always be doing something. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put yourself in the shoes of the lion tamer or the ring master. You would be a big mess wouldn't you...I bet some of you would hide and run, or just stand there not knowing how to do anything that you intended you thought you knew.To avoid this that's why all members in the circus practice.( in the paragraph above ) Has anybody in the circus mess up? Of coarse they have. Anyone can mess up in a play or performance.<u><b>ANYONE</b></u>&nbsp; Anyone can mess up , but only a few people can cover up a mistake by going along with it.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Traveling around the world is what the circus does. Pretending to be in a circus or be a lion tamer at home to entertain is&nbsp;one thing, but being in <b><u>the circus</u></b> is another. Some people can get this one in a lifetime chance of being in the circus, but they have to commit to all the practice,being away from home, and constantly traveling almost nonstop.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Imagine having a closet full of clothes for all different acts. people in the circus have that .You can't just have one pair of costumes for <b>every</b> act so that is why they have so many costumes.How many places can the circus go in a year? Perhaps hundreds.In a lot of circuses they have a highly trained man or woman who may do magician tricks. Such as Houdini's water tank trick. In this trick someone has to go in a tank full of water while they are in a whole bunch of chains wrapped around their body.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Circus animals are highly trained before acting in the circus. Especially the wild animals such as the leopards and tigers. All these animals need to be trained in order to be in the circus. If not the people working with them might get seriously hurt or even die. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024093242	562	2		20131024134040	539	2		20131025145638	552	2

Then, we heard a loud squeal.</p> <p>&quot;Its coming from one of the elephants!&quot; Cameron yelled. An elephant lost control and ran into a section of people. There were screams coming from everywhere. The elephant rammed through the red and yellow striped tent and ran away.

She loved training Starlight so much she continued training her with another horse.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of 21, Elyssa joined the circus.

My trick was a success! Flipping off a running horse was a great idea! I wrote in my journal. &quot;Lights out.&quot; mom said.

I'm 2'1, and 20 years old.I'll tell you about my life at the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes life at the circus isn't just fun and games. Being the world's smallest man just isn't very fun sometimes.Sure I have 1,000,000s of fans all across the globe.But there's a down side too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There a lot of bad things about&nbsp; being the world's smallest man. People always cut in line because they don't see me.The cooks at pie car can't see me so I almost never eat. Worst of all no one takes me seriously because I'm so small and I have a high pitch voice. But there are upsides, and a lot of them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The upsides of&nbsp; being the world's smallest man is why I keep this job. I get to go all over the world and meet so many people, it makes my head spin! I get standing Os at almost every place we go. I get paid thousands of dollars each year.Those are the upsides.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well now you know what's like being the smallest man on earth. Even though there are upsides I don't recommend being the smallest man on earth.( Even though I don't you could help it if you were)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S.

But for me there is people flying all over the place. Jumping off animals, flying off ropes in the air, and people launching themselves high into the air. The whole time i was at the circus i couldn't believe my eyes was looking at this stuff. It was like all these circus people were monkeys. Everything was so crazy i don't think i blinked once till the end of the show.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scary part of the show was when the clowns fell right on to There unicycles. [By the way i absolutely positively hate clowns with all my heart] I still can't believe that there are actually cool things that were in my town. My seat was in the front row next to the cotton candy stand. My little sister was next to me. My best friend jimmy was next to me about to pee his pants. He wasn't the only one. I could've had a heart attack when the lion jumped through the ring of fire. That was by far the scariest thing I've seen. Even more scary then my neighborhood haunted house. Thats why why i liked it. I bet big jimmy felt the same. My sister probally liked all that gymnastics stuff.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that i was wiped out.

This is the story of how I became a kangaroo.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day on a sunny tuesday I woke up in my bejeweled trailer next to my pet baby tiger named Ggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Then i rode my pet ostrich to the circus ground to talk to the nice magician named Lola, but everyone calls her The Great Bannana.We call her this because its her stage name. When I got to her I jumped off my ostrich did a triple flip and land on Lola. I said sorry but she was mad so she punched me in the face and went to kick me&nbsp; but then Wallllllprido my pet elephant whacked Lola in the stomach whith her trunk. Now she was steamed she vowed that she would do some thing horrible to me. So i went to my bestfriend Marshal the acrobatic to ask for advice he told me to say sorry. Then i went to her tent and said sorry but she did not acept it she said i would have to do a lot mor to makeup with her. Then the time came for our circus show so everybody ran to the tent getting ready. Thats when i got the idea to makeup whith lola. When lola was doing her act I came in riding a purple camel with one thousand flowers being holded by my friend acrobatics then the spotlight went on lola and i said sorry. Then something horible happened she started bloating up yelling thatsshe is alergic to camels and flowers. Then she took her magic wand and shot a rainbow bolt of light at me and i was turned into a kangaroo.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the story of how i became a kangaroo.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023215600	537	1		20131024102637	541	1

Oh you might think that it's fun to hangout in the circus with a bunch of clowns that might even be your mom and dad, but no. The circus is much different than what you think. The typical that is for you is the same as for us:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day at 7:00 A.M. We wake up, get dressed, and go to the pie car for breakfast, which is where the circus performers eat. The crews set up the tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:00 A.M. is when the school starts. Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school, ours has computers, homework, tests, and report cards. because the circus performers are from all over the world, we get to learn new languages during class.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At 3:45 school is dismissed. time for a quick break! since most of my friends are clowns and acrobats, I get to play on the trampoline, I get to juggle, and play with their unicycles. I usually take out my bunny ginger and walk her around the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 4:30 I start my chores. I comb the horses and do my homework. After doing all my chores, I talk to my mom about ever going back home. Usually she says, &quot;but honey, I thought it was your dream to be here.&quot; but I can't take all the tears I've been holding just suddenly come out. &quot;But mom i want to go back home. It's too hard to live here.&quot; I cried.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been here so long. Will I be leaving soon?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113951	556	2		20131024151656	537	2		20131025154455	543	2

You can also be animal tamer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; If you want to be an acrobat, tohave to be trained by an expert. The easiest thing to be in an circus is a clown.

I mean do you really think that you could get talents like ares from one lesson. Working with the circus isnt as easy as it looks and you can learn about me and what I do, emotional feelings, and just the fun of it in the following paragraphs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First up hard work, the reason all this happens.In this circus we have actrobats, clows,trapises artists and so much more.Now that takes hardwork. As for me ,well Im all about the stunts.I walk across ropes, diveboard into a little pool and I sometimes train the elephants to do tricks too. But what makes this show is hard work.The typical day is pretty much training and im not talking about mentoring someone else, you have to train youself. After a long day of&nbsp; doing that I go and eat at the pie car and conserve my energy for the mantinee.At the end of the day im completly wiped out and take a long rest for tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, im going to tell you about what happens here a lot, emotional feelings.You may not know this but we are a long way from home, we rarely see are families and we can never stop in one place for too long.During shows you see us as people who are always happy and i guess you could say that but ther is also a downside to living with the circus.We work long days and are always thinking about that nights show.So now you see that the circus isnt all that you think.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last I want to tell you about the fun that ive had with the circus.</p> <p>I have seen so many things while being at the circus. I enjoy seeing the clowns ride on thier unicycles and juggling balls.Every night I go and see one of my old friends act, summersalting of the back of a horse as for his daughter shes trying to leap off a trampoline onto the back of a horse.The circus is so fun and nothing can spoil it</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now you see that even though the circus isnt all fun and games its still the best thing ever and ever day ends with me smiling and knowing I made someone smile back.Thats what the circus is all about.This has been WORKING WITH THE CIRCUS.</p>	1		20131023150911	690	1		20131023155903	552	1

That <b>IS</b> what it feels like, I thought. I got out my storybook and wrote down that thought. I am Jenelle Handler. I am a part of the Golden Globe Circus. We travel around the world performing. I am a trapeze artist, and the youngest one too. Many people come from around the world just to see the youngest trapeze artist in the world. But there is one thing that I wish could change. I wish I did not have to work all day. But it is very fun! I get to perform for many young children, and it is truly magical seeing them gape in wonder. I have so much fun everyday. I practice my routine on trapeze everyday with my other trapeze friends. They are very good, and sometimes I have trouble keeping up with them. But they always see me struggling and they always are glad to help me figure out one of the steps.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a performance every other night. It is great fun, flying around doing flips in the air. It is almost like I can fly! Tonight we did a spectacular performance, and Lady Electra was especially amazing. She was in a very good mood today, so she asked for more electricity in her ball of electricity. She even made the electric strands different colors!!! It was truly amazing. What else do I have to tell you? Oh yes!! The costumes were phenomenal!! We had turquoise leotards with a little tail that was so soft and fluffy it was like having little wisps of clouds trailing behind me. We had a small head piece with a turquoise jewel in the middle and little feathers sticking up behind it. Yes, our costumes were the highlight of the day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have yet another thing to tell you, yet it is not quite as good. One of our performers had landed on the netting a tad bit strange, and she twisted her ankle. She could not participate in the show tonight, so one of the trapeze parts was cancelled. Oh, how she cried! She told me that it was to be the most spectacular performance the world had ever seen, and now she was in a cast watching us! It must have been horrible for her. I know it would have been devastating for me. I watched her as she sat in a chair, watching us with longing eyes. I wish she could get better as quick as a bunny can hop!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, with that, I end this story of one of my days in the circus. Don't worry, there are plenty more coming. I have about 13 more! I hope you enjoyed this story, Dear Diary. There's meny more for me to tell you, but right now I have to go to sleep. It already took me about 15 minutes just to write this small story.

My family moved to the U.S. from Russia when I was five years old and began in the circus thre months after we got here. Life in the circus is fun but there are always downsides to everything. I will be telling you about the life, the upsides and downsides in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will first tell you about the downsides for being a circus preformer. Well first of all, you never stay at one place for very long because your always moving. That means that you can never make friends there because you wont see them for another year. Another downside is you dont get enough sleep sometimes because the shows are so late. Those are the downsides for being a circus preformer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I will tell you the upsides for being a circus preformer. First of all, its like being able to play infront of a big crowd. You also get to meet different people from different countries because so many people join the circus internationally. Being in a travelling circus you get to travel the U.S. and sometimes even the world! Those are the upsides for being a circus preformer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I will tell you about the schedule in the circus. I usually wake up around six or seven A.M.&nbsp; and go get breakfest at the pie car (were we eat our meals) and then help the crews set up the tent's and stuff for the preformance. Just like any other kid, I have to go to school at about eight A.M. It's just like any other school only it has one room. School usually ends at three P.M. and I usually take a break before I have to do my chores and practice for the show. For chores I usually groom, feed and water the animals sucha s elephants and lions. I also practice my skit, I am a lion tamer. Once I am done I eat dinner and then go to the show. After the show, I go to bed while the crew packs up and then we are headed to another town. That is a average day as a circus preformer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have told you the upsides, the downside and the schedule of being a circus preformer. It is really fun and hope to do it all my life. When I get older I hope to be a acrobat. Thanks for reading this and I hoped you learned something.</p>	2		20131021140951	562	2		20131021154748	556	2		20131022141112	552	2

To be in the circus its really hard work. Just because you think your in the circus that schools out but its not. After school you do chores and clean then when your all done you have to practice a lot. Some things you have to do is feed and clean the horses. Then you have dinner and then the show is over.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You just can't come to the circus and just become a clown. You have to be ready for the rhode ahead of you. Plus you have put your heart into being certain that you want to join the circus. You give everything up to join the circus and concentrate on dancing and performing. Plus theres an up side to all of this you get to travel all over the world. thats the life of a circus life.</p>	1		20131023130433	556	1		20131023152450	935	1

So then it was 8:00 and the house was packed with friends and family,but then my mom told them that I was going to a circus but it was different its like american idol but not with animals.So then they asked me to sing for them but i said if you give me money,and they said ok.So i sang When I Was your man</p>	1		20131024153258	541	1		20131025084519	552	1

It gives you the opportunity to go to many places. You perform in front of a live audience. You get to have fun and play every night. It also great to see the faces of the amazed audience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, are the downsides. The life of a circus performer isn,t justfun and games. Circus performers work long days and stay away from home for a long time. On tour your always thinking about the show. Also you don't have time to calll home. You also work on the weekends.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the life of a circus performer is hard. You have to have special skills and talents. There are also lots of ups and downs of being a circus performer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113840	690	2		20131024135138	562	2		20131025160546	543	2

I, John Parker, know that the circus is not crazy, even though it may seem like it. I live in a trailer with my family and friends. We travel all across the world visiting 100,000 cities a year! I help set up the circus and I perform in it too. My act is the tightrope walk.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a normal day for me:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 A.M. I wake up, get dressed, and head to the pie car to eat breakfast. The breakfast is usually pancakes, bacon sausage, milk and cereal. After breakfast I have to head over to set up the circus tents, lights, and music for the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:30 A.M. It is time to practice our acts. Like I said before my act is the tightrope. On the tightrope it is important to keep your balance so you don't fall. You also get a pole to help keep your balance. It is actually really fun once you get the hang of it. There is also a net at the bottom, so if you fall you don't get seriously hurt.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:30 A.M. After we are done practicing our acts, it is time for school. We have a one room schoolhouse that travels with us everywhere. We learn things that we would learn in a regular school, like math, science, social studies, and language. In the schoolhouse we have computers, tests and report cards.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:30 P.M. After school is over we get to practice our acts again. I enjoy practicing my act, so I don't care how many times I have to practice it. on my first try on the tightrope it was scary, but now I've gotten used to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:00 P.M. We head over to the pie car for a small dinner, because we are doing the show soon. We eat tacos and some salad for dinner. I have a big stomach, so I don't get full easily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:30 P.M. I am completely wiped out. When I get back to our trailer I get undressed and go to bed. I have to get a good nights sleep because we repeat the same thing tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a normal day for me at the circus.</p>	2		20131023153155	562	2		20131024113829	935	2

We have many people in our circus family, that include clown, acrobats, trainers, and many circus animals.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We travel to about everywhere you can think of. Even though the circus is fun games we still do school work. Not like teaching us how to paint our face and walk around with a big red nose or tripping over giant shoes. We learn math, science, reading, and more.</p> <p>&nbsp; My favorite animal here is my pet elephant Rosa. Our circus first got her when she was only a baby. Rosa&nbsp; was a little shy at first. Now she walks out in little tutus and struts her stuff.</p> <p>&nbsp; I wear bright colored leotards and do acrobats with my sister Molly. My younger brother Jamie does tricks on circus horses. My father is a ring master. MY mother she does tight rope walking. Scary right.</p> <p>&nbsp; Many things come across here on the road. We have always been in the circus. I was born in Nashville. Molly was born in Honolulu. Jamie he waas born in Austin, Texas. We have been everywhere i guess you can say.</p> <p>&nbsp; Well i could write all day but i have a show tonight like always.</p>	2		20131023130535	537	1		20131023140900	539	2		20131025123549	543	2

Then I started practicing for todays circus at 6:00 P.M.. Next I fed the animals and rest a little bit.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next I ate a little food and got ready for the circus. Then we started the circus and showed the animals, it was fun. Then we juggled for half a hour. Last we had a big grand fanally.</p>	1		20131022120126	562	1		20131022134427	545	1

I like being</b> <b>in the circus because it is fun,and it gives you a rush when you are flying through the air. All you can do is smile and have fun. One thing i dont like about the circus is that you are away from home alot and some people have to drop out because of homesicknes. then we have to do addishions 1 day befor the circus. I do tite rope walking and i also do rope spinning. </b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can have 2,3,or even 4 people in one act. Have you ever been in a circus or went to one? If not you need to we look forwerd to haveing a big crowd and people coming to watch as out there doing what we love!!!!!!!! What i want to learn in the futer and do as an act is &quot;tamming a lion&quot; i think I would be happy and worried because one,*it would be fun to tame a lion and 2nd *it would be scary because the lion could go CRAZY and hurt you.&nbsp; There are so many diffrent acts in the circus and they can be tiring at some points. some people dont get to call home. Ok i think that is enough from me on to Jenna.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Jenna i am one of theperformers in the circus and i am a lion tammer. i like to train them because i think with me growing up in&nbsp; Texas and i like diffrent tyips of wild life and yes,yes i no there arnt lions in texas. I got into the circus by going to the circus and when i went in they wanted to know if i was good with animals and to this day i dont know why they asked that question. well i have told my storie so now it is on to Cole.</b></p> <p><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is cole. i like hamburgers. They are my favorite food and this has nothing to do with the circus. Ok, so back to the storie i like to do tite rope walking and i find it fun and it gives you a rush whale you are tite rope walking. Have you ever wanted to tite rope walk? If you haven't, well you should. so i grew up in New Jersey. I LOVE talking in a jersey acsent. I&nbsp; never grew up with any animals and i didnt want to be a tammer i came to the try outs and got in because i was THE BEST out of EVERYONE. I am awsome and everybody nows it but wont admit it. </u></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am lion billy bob mammi jo and i like to eat EVERYTHING they wont feed me 205 times a day and i think it is unfair!!!!!! Did you know that i am i the world record book for being SO fat. hahahahaha i should NOT be proud of that. Well i have to go by.

You get to ride horses, in little cars, elephants, and swinging back and forth on rings. You get to meet lots of new people and clowns. So I think circus life is a fun life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021113622	541	1		20131021132625	537	1

It will take about 35 minutes to arrive at the circus. Well my dad told me to pack all the stuff I needed for the circus. I packed three water bottles, a camera, and my stuffed elephant, Joey. My mom put all the things we are going to bring in the trunk while my dad started the engine. I hopped in the seat and put on my seat belt.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart was pumping with joy! I held my stuffed elephant, Joey in my arms and whispered to him, &quot;You will see lots of other elephants at the circaus, I promise.&quot; My mom checked if I had my seat belt on and she gave me a thumbs up. 35 minutes has nbeen past and we are at the circus! We just need to find a parking space and pay.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found a good parking spot and then paid for it. So we went in the circus and gave our tickets to the ticket man. Our seat were in the middle column in the middile row. I could see very well. And then the announcer spoke into the mic, &quot; Is everybody ready to have some fun and watch these amazing performers?&quot; &quot;YES!&quot; Everybody shouted. My dad told me the show was about to start in 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1... The show started!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a juggler on an elephant and the guy on the elephant were juggling 5 bowling pins! And then we saw people doing trapeze on high distances! 2 seals were spinning red balls on their noses. All of a sudden, a women with big hats stacked on top of each other and threw the hats to the audience! One came to me, and there was a note on the hat that said. &quot;You are chosen, you may come up on the stage and learn many tricks from the clowns and our crew. Come on down with us and have some fun!&quot; I went down to with the performers!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom and dad smiled at me in a happy mood. Then a friendly man approached me and taught me how to juggle three bowling pins. I got the hang of it and it wasn't actually that hard! Many people were cheering for me! I was so happy and proud of myself! So now I knew how it felt to be in a circus. The feeling deep down in my heart was full of passion! 10 minutes later, I went back to my seats with my parents. They gave me a kiss on the cheek and gave me a hug. It felt warm.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus crew is going to do the grand finalle! They brought out a flag and one person was holding a green flag and went to ride the bike. One by one, people at the crew jumped on the bike and waved their green bike! There were like 27 people on on bike waving their flag saying, &quot; Hoped you enjoyed our show! Thank you all!&quot; When the show was over, I had a really good mood and told my parents, &quot;mom, dad, I want to woek at a circus someday.&quot; They smiled at eac other and then looked at me. They said, &quot;Of course you can dear.&quot; They gave me a big hug and told me to get in the car. I put my seat belt on, held onto Joey, and went back home.</p>	2		20131023152506	539	2		20131023220047	537	2

You have practice very hard, you work long hours and weekends, and you spend a lot of time away from home. Some people spend over seven months away from home!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First,</p> <p>You have to get up early to get your food at the pie car and get dressed. You also have to do chores and practice your act. Some chores include grooming the show animals. If you want to be an acrobat, you can't just sign up with no experience. You have to have a fit body, lots of energy, and determination. You also have to do a lot of shows. You almost never get a break.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next,</p> <p>In the world of a circus, you just don't do chores and perform. You have to go to school, too! Since there are some people in circuses from around the world, they might speak a different language. Sometimes they might know english and they can tell you about their country! That's one way to learn more about a country that you would like to visit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Afterward,</p> <p>Some people never have time to do what they want. They have so many shows a week that there isn't enough time. When I was in a play called, &quot;The Little Mermaid, Jr.&quot; I wanted to spend time with my friends, but with rehearsal I never had time. The good yet bad newsis that it's eventually going to end. If you wanted to sign up for a sport, go for it. The bad part about it though is that you'll have to part with your castmates, unless you give them some way to keep contoact with them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion,</p> <p>Being in a circus isn't all fun and games. It takes a lot of determination and a lot of time. You have to get up early, have enough energy to get through the day, and you have to go to bed late. It takes a while to get used to it, though it's lots of fun. I would want to join a circus, would you?</p>	2		20131023130535	537	2		20131023133543	539	2		20131025111201	543	2

There is alot of trayning you have to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First, You would have to get ready for the day and go to school. Now, it wouldn't be all <b>circus</b> school, its just like regular school. Math, Reading, Spelling, Sciance and every thing else.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, You would have to practice all day till that nights show and that would be a very long afternoon. You won't realy get to eat much cuse you would be doing a <b>circus</b> in a cuple hours. And how ever you pracise it, thats how you are going to do it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Last, You would be so tired after doing that <b>circus</b> thing and dont forget you have to do chors. So, inconclusion, its realy not that easy.</p>	1		20131023150658	541	1		20131023213635	545	1		20131025134856	552	1

Not a scary clown from the movies, I'm just a clown. I like it when little kids laugh. I also like when I get to do things with hula-hoops and stuff like juggling around, Walking on tight ropes, acting like a monkey, and others. So to become a clown you need,</p>  <br>Lots of training <br>Good breakfasts <br>Healthy <br>Not over overweight (as in 300 pounds) <br>And must like to entertain people  <p>So the first thing you need is makeup. Then you need a costume. Finally, you need a prop. When you need to train, just go to the circus and copy what the clowns do. When you do that for 2 years you will officially be a clown</p>	2		20131024095447	556	1		20131024112709	541	2		20131025145742	543	2

I Katherin Pearce a horse trainer in the Mistic Falls Circus am nerves because the horse are all scared and nerves they won't stop yanking the rope. All of the horse trainer are nerves too. If we don't get them to calm down the hole show will <b>end.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So before we start this is my story. I was born and rased in Texax. When I was little I always had a love for horses so my parents got me 1. I named her Jersey. So after that I begain to learn trikes on her. So before I new it I wanted to be in the circus. Like my great-great-grandad, but my Mom and Dad said know <b><u>!!!</u></b><b><u>NO!!!</u></b>. So I had to finish scool and go to callage so I did. Then after that I rain ran away to the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hard to find the write circus for me. I wanted to be in the one that my great-great-grandad was in. Sadly I couldn't find it. Then out of noware it showed up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I ran right over to and asked&quot;Can I be in your circus?&quot;. They said yes but I had to tell them what I can do. So I did I told them about them all my tricks with Jersey. Also that all I need is my trailor and Jersey. So I got them&nbsp; and went.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now that you know my story I can tell you how I am going to get the horses to calm down. First all the hoses here have a great brian that we all trained so we just need to find the right comand to calm them down.&nbsp; &quot;Wait I got,&quot;I say. We all have to get on our horses back and tell them to calm down. We all do it and it <b><u>WORKS!!!!!.</u></b> After that we preform and it's perfect.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats the story on how Katherin Pearce and her horse Jersey saved the Mistic Falls Circus.</p>	1		20131021160252	556	1		20131022100441	541	1

It's always been my dream to travel with a circus, and now it has finally come true. But your dreams come with a price. I had to leave my family behind in Sister Bay, Wisconsin. I told them I didn't have to go if they wanted me to stay with them but they told me to go follow my dreams and that I would see them again every once in a while when the circus went to Wisconsin.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from my family, I have plenty of other things to worry about. Tomorrow is my first show. Ever. I've been practicing for for months but I'm not sure I've mastered the final trick to my act where I'm on a rope hanging from the ceiling and I have to twirl my self around in every which way and then at the very right second I have to let go, land on a trampoline and land in the arms of a clown who will be waiting for me. I know, right.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well now they are going to make me go have some last minute practice. When I get there they'll be all over me. Making me put on some makeup and a costume then making me paractice my final trick. I don't want to go to practice. At least not today. But still I somehow&nbsp; drag myself down the hallway and into the tent where everything is set up for tomorrow's show. &quot;Katie!&quot; I hear my best friend Bella call my name from the corner where she is practicing her juggling routine.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knows I'm nervous by the look on my face. &quot;You're going to do fine tomorrow.&quot; she says as I enter the juggling station. I sigh. &quot;I hope you're right I say.&quot; After a lot of juggling and practicing my little tricks before the final one&nbsp; I finally get to practice what I came here to practice. My final piece. The rope falls and I grip it in my hand. Before I know it I'm being lifted off the ground and it's time for me to begin.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spin in all different directions. Up, down, left , right. Now comes the hard part where I have to let go at just the right second. I take a deep breath and let go. I land in the clown's arms. I exhale. I did it. Before I know it tomorrow is here and I'm backstage getting my makeup and costume put on.&nbsp; I head out and for a moment the lights blind me and then I hear the roar of the crowd.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I'm spinning in the air and the moment comes. I let go and fly through the air. I land in the saftey of the clowns arms. I did it. I have finally made my dream come true.<br> <br> &nbsp;</p> <p><br> &nbsp;</p> <p>\</p>	2		20131021145708	537	2		20131021152206	562	2

They opened up the u-haul truck's latch in the back, and went inside to reveal a lizard the size of a medium dog. &quot;Wow, so bizarre.&quot; I said sarcastically.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They took the little lizard into one of the cages designed for changing to fit the animal.&nbsp; Later, I went to feed the thing a dead hare, and it spread some thin strips of skin on either side of it's scaley body, and flew to me.</p>	2		20131024102425	690	2		20131024112823	539	2		20131025143918	552	2

The TV was on, and an advertisment was on the screen. They said, &quot;Do you want to see some real entertainment? Then grab a pencil and start drawing, because your anual circus is having a contest to see who can draw the best circus drawing in the history of the world. The winner of the contest gets three tickets to go see a circus near them. They also get their picture to be an advertisement all over the world.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned off the TV, grabbed my drawing pencil, and got to work drawing the best picture I had ever drawn. It had elephants on it, trapeze flyers, and even a clown on a unicycle! It was very cool until I had accidentally misplaced my drawing the day I wanted to turn it in. We searched all over town when we finally found it by the toy shop. It had flown out the window, and the wind carried it over there.&nbsp; I had turned my drawing in just as the deadline had arrived. It was the most wonderful drawing they had ever seen. I could tell just by the look on their faces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the time had come for them to announce who the winner was, my eyes shot right out of their sockets. They had called my name! When it was time for us to go see the circus, I took with me my dad and his friend. We all had a very good time there.We saw everything I had drew on my poster, only even cooler.&nbsp; I still couldn't believe that I won the contest when I saw my poster on the wall of a building. I was always happy when I remembered the day I won those tickets.</p>	2		20131024065933	693	2		20131024090056	562	2

I have been performing since I was five, I am eleven now and I have been riding and doing stunts off and on top of elephants for four years. when I was little, in my first years of preforming, I used to be the smallest and most-loved clown in the show. I used to wear a big fluffy red nose and with white face paint, red dimples, and a big fluffy rainbow-colored&nbsp; head wig.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>Show Time</b></u></p> <p><b>Show day is my favorite day of the week. We woke up at seven o'clock this morning, ate our breakfast, then started getting ready for the show. Even though most shows start at night,we're different, and our show starts at ten in the morning. I went down to the trailer that I shared with my best friend Kayla, who was also an elephant performer. She was already dressed in her sparkly pink tee-shirt, black skinny jeans, knee-high white boots, white top hat, and a white walking stick with black tips. I know that this seems like a weird outfit to wear for riding an elephant, but we all have to mach the certain elephant that we were riding, so for me that meant white, black, and lime green. I walked over to my closet, and pulled out my outfit that i had had custom made for the biggest show of the year, and i was the opening act. My outfit consisted of black spandex pants, a white ruffled top, an elbow-length lime green jean jacket, a black and white top hat with a white rim, and a black walking stick with white tips. Kayla and I had to use walking sticks because as the opening act we had to open with us on elephants then doing a back flip off and then doing a dance. My dad is the ring master, so he is really important to my act, he needs to be able to direct the elephants in the right direction so i can do my tricks on its back without worrying about actually riding it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Lights, Camera, Action! </u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> I am waiting for my elephant to be brought to me when one of the handlers comes and says,&quot;Becca, come quickly, we can't find Leafy!&quot; I could barely hear him but I was so worried about my elephant that I couldn't think, then I came to my senses and ran as fast as I could toward the elephant stables. When I got to the stables I ran as fast as I could toward Leafy stall, but he wasn't there. This had only happened to me once before when I was nine and I forgot to latch the stall all the way, then I remembered where i had found him last time, eating hay! I was so happy that I had an idea where he might be, I took off running again calling his name as I went. When I thought that he was gone for good I reached the hay stack, ant there he was.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show ran smoothly, and I was the star of the show.&nbsp; Everyone was amazed at how talented Leafy was and at the end of the show when they called my name i got a standing ovation that lasted for five minutes! This had to be my best show yet, and I was so sad to see it end. I love the circus, we are one big, loud, crazy family.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>	2		20131021133217	562	2		20131021145335	556	2

I was thrilled to go. I had never been to the circus. I was going with my parents. They gave me five dollars to go get a drink. While I was walking, I saw one of the clowns. I went up to the clown and shook his hand. He said his name was Sammy. I left, but before I left he gave me a big red nose.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came back, the show had stared. I sat by my parents. I was lucky to have front row seats because I could see everything. A few minutes later I saw Sammy. He said he wanted a volunteer. I raised my hand as fast as I could. He saw me and called me. He told on to his hand. I jumped on. Then he put us through a ring of fire. I was really scared. It was getting really hot so I was slipping. Suddenly, I fell and part of my leg was on fire and I had broken my leg. I screamed really loud.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I had fell unconcious and just had a dream. When I awoke I saw I was in a hospital bed. I saw my parents and they&nbsp; rushed to me. My mom was sobbing a lot. I looked on the other side and I saw the clown Sammy. Sammy was holding &quot;Sorry&quot; balloons in his hand. I was really sad for Sammy because he could have lost his job. I asked my parents how long had I been unconcious. They said for three days. I looked down at my right foot. I saw part of it was cut off. The other leg was broken really bad. Then I asked Sammy if he had lost his job. He said yes. I felt bad for Sammy.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few weeks later I had had surgery. I had got a mechanical right foot. I had crutches for my leg. I was walking with Sammy down the sidewalk. He was looking to get back into clown business. He walked to his old circus. They said he could join but he had to have a professional volunteer for his tricks. Sammy said he would join. Now everybody was happy. Just how I liked it.</p>	2		20131022120029	690	2		20131022161158	935	2

Now I know what your thinking &quot;wow this kid has got it good&quot; well think a again. I have a very tough life one reason is because I have to wake up at six a.m. and start practicing right after breakfast. I have a show every night at nine and they end at ten thirty it is really tiring.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Plus I walk the tightrope it takes years of practice to know how to actually walk on two inches of rope. It is fun and all but another thing is I have to stay away from my house and my family it is actually pretty sad when I think about them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;One thing that I love is that we travel around the world. We go to Japan, China, and all over Germany. In my free time I usually help the lion tamers work on there act. It is pretty fun to watch the lions roar.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;By the way if you would want to be in the circus it takes a lot of time to practice your special talent. Because they dont let just anybody, and you have to work and work. Remember never give up!</p>	1		20131023162629	552	1		20131024102315	693	1		20131025145034	539	1

For at least Bella Castini she knows the truth. She works at the circus and knows it is alot more work than many people do. She wakes up early and eats breakfast and gets ready. She sitll has a day at school. Like any school she has computers, tests, and report cards. Later she has to do many chores and start practicieng for the show. For Bella Castini she does en shows a week: one each weekday, plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.

Have or have not I'm gonna tell you all about the circus! first of all there are alot, and I mean alot of cool acts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One type of circus preformer is an acrobat. An acrobat is a person who does things like flipping off a trampoline into a net, or flips off of those swings that have a bar instead of a seat. That's the kind of things an acrobat does. Acrobats do things that you probably wouldn't do, as I just explained above. The things an acrobat does are kind of scary to think of, but they're really cool.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another type of circus preformer is a clown. Clowns dress funny and do all sorts of crazy things. Some funny things clowns do is about 20 clowns climbing into a really tiny car, or honking a horn, and spraying water out of a flower in their shirt pocket. Clowns are really funny and cool.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the circus there are also animal trainers. Animal trainers do things like making elephants do funny tricks and getting lions or tigers to jump through a ring of fire. Really they just work with animals.

Later, a few hours before the show, i rush out to the animal car and start training animals one by one. after i train the animals, i give each animal a treat. i give them a treat because that way they will cooperate with me.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the circus show is over. all the workers go for dinner. then, we pack up the circus and get ready to sleep.

There were so many clowns, one wheeled motorcycles, a trapeze and many acrobats. The crowd was wild and there were more than 20,000 people! Let me tell you a full view about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first act was the trapeze act. The trapezist swung between both ropes and hung upside down. Then his partner lit a torch and set the rope on fire. The trapezist then ran on top of the rope and he jumped back down.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next act was the acrobatics and the act I was in! I swung on the rope and my partner lit a hoop on fire. I quickly flung and went right through the hoop. After this the crowd cheered.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our final act was the animal act. We let out the horses and lions. The lions jumped through a ring of fire and then were bouncing on the trapeze. Then the horses ran through the crowd and balanced on the balance beam.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This show was great and I hope our next one is like this one too!</p>	2		20131021100639	545	2		20131021104355	562	2

There were clowns, unicyclists, actors who did the trapeze, acrobats like me, and many other people. Let me tell you all about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our first act was the trapeze. The actor who did the trapeze swung upside down and right side up near the top of the tent. Meanwhile, a tightrope walker walked across a rope at between two towers. The crowd applauded.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next act was the animal trick act. Five tigers stood on top of each other and the one at the top waved a flag. The crowd liked this a lot. There was huge applause.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The act after that was the act I was in. Me and my trapeze partner, Bob, did loops forwards an backwards in the air while swinging back and forth, while at the same time, clowns did acts like walking into each other to make the audience laugh. The audience liked this act the best. They applauded very loudly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The last act was when all the actors came onstage and did their acts at the same time. The audience was laughing and applauding at the same time! After this act was done, the audience gave us circus performers a standing ovation. We bowed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This performance was great. I hope the next one is like this one, too!</p>	2		20131024113951	556	1		20131024151656	537	2		20131025154532	539	2

Matt was stuck with a rope tied that tied his hands together, riding an elephant. Matt was born into the circus, like everyone else, his dad is the boss. He had got up every day at 5:00 just to practice this act and make his dad proud . But every time his dad id there he turn into a colossal wreck. It was now breakfast time (7:00) I went to the pie cart I picked up some cheese bagels with clueberry cream cheese and hot chocolate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>School time, I am the best in the class I answer very question corectly. 7+9986= ? I knew that. Soon it is over,</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Chores the one thing I hate, I have to groom all the animals, I love our baby leopards. More practice I am still not getting my act and it is the spotlight of our performence. Finally I get it but I fall down. Then I try it for the last time, with my heart, and I suceed with the last bit of effort, my dad sees me. He says,&quot; Wow i am impressed I can't believe how good you've become lets wait for tonights show, lets see.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Soon it is dinner time I am queezy an didn't touch a single thing, I got butterflies in my stomach. Finally it is my turn, my father was crossing his fingers, my mother is confident, and my brother is teasing me. Uncle Hoppy ties my hands together, and puts me on the elephant.&nbsp; Finally I do my stunt , again with my heart I and pull it off. Everyone is applauding I was the star of the show. My father has earned my confidence.</p>	1		20131022165130	562	2		20131023090511	539	1		20131025091401	543	1

Not only that, they would give us a lot of money to upgrade our circus!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had thought that it would be easy, like every time we perform, but it was a <b><b>lot</b></b> harder than I had thought. We had to make sure that the place was clean, unlike before, and we also had to make it so that it looked fancy, also unlike before.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it was time. They appeared just very fancily, wearing clothes made from the finest material. I began, &quot;Welcome to the Wonderful Animal Circus! Today, we will show you the wonderful skill of our performers!&quot; They then applauded, to my surprise.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did the best we could, going through the whole thing without a single mistake. After it was over, I went over to them and asked,&quot;Well, what do you think of the Wonderful Animal Circus?&quot; They looked at each other, agreed on something and said,&quot;It was wonderful! We were amazed and will spread the word as we promised! We will also give you the money that we also promised you.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later, I received some mail from each of the presidents. Inside each one was $1,000,000! I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe it! There was enough money to create two more circuses! We soon attracted a lot more people, and made more money.

The truth is, circus life is hard, and you need to have a specific talent and train hard. Thats why your friend don't just run away from home and become a famous trapeze artists. That's why, I, Bobby Chan, is here to warn you not everyone could be part of a circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, if your a circus performer, you are rarely at home. Instead, you are on a train, traveling around the world. I would rather stay at home than ride on this train, having a headache while typing and reading this story. There's not enough space to play any kind of sport. It's rather boring around here.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the afternoon, we feed, and groom the animals. we also spend the time training for tonight's performance. We do all kinds of tricks such as juggling, and acrbatics. As I said, it is not as easy as you think. We had to train for years just to get a perfect flip.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm wiped out now. It's right now 10:30 P.M., right after the show. I just walked back to the train for a nice long sleep. It's much more conforting to sleep at home rather than over here. I'm warning you: Being a circus performer is not conforting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022203938	545	2		20131023130534	537	2		20131025101353	543	2

The crowd is super amazed about what me and my partner just did. Hi I'm Bob and this a story about me and my circus life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Well at first, there was a town in circus that needed people with special talents and good confidence, they should be confident workers. So I said to myself, &quot; Why not try out. Right?&quot; I didn't know that this was the start of a new life for me, but let me tell you what happened.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After a lot of stretching, I was finally ready to get in the circus. I was a super great juggler so I tried to for the clown that juggles. I was one of the two clowns that made the try outs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After that I had a daily schedule and it was pure circus life after that. After a few months it was time for my first show. Me and my partner were juggling together and everything turned out great.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This was a clown circus so everyone was a clown, but the main clowns were me and my partner. We had the star act which came at the very end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We tried even harder for the next show. Our starring act was even better. We were juggling flaming torches together. There were six of them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the next show there was a sign saying:</p> <p>CLOWN CIRCUS:</p> <p>STARRING BOB AND HIS AMAZING PARTNER BOBBY</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That is my story, and now we are in the present. I finally retired after 10 years of performing. Although being in a circus is hard, if you are determined and hard-working, you are a recipe for success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161226	690	2		20131023131555	693	2

I practice juggling 10 balls for tonight's show. At 7:00 p.m. Dinnertime. I eat rice with egg every Friday, but rice with soup everyday. Our shows are from 7:30-10:00 p.m.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 p.m. I go to sleep, and I think about my real home in California. Every night I think about it. I miss my home, but I have to deal with it.</p>	2		20131024113856	545	2		20131024141400	935	2

This is unusual for me because usually, I sulk in bed for at least thirty minutes before I drag myself out of my bed. Anyway, I threw on my clothes and clumsily brushed my teeth. I accidentally got toothpaste in my eye but couldn't help rushing. Today, I was going to the circus!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once&nbsp; my parents and my sister woke up, I nagged them until they got out of bed. I flew down the stairs and probably set a world record for the fastest time for running down the stairs. I poured myself a bowl of cereal and accidentally poured milk on my shirt. At this point, I decided to slow down a bit. By the time we all ate breakfast, the show was about to start. We sprinted to our old Toyota Prius and started the one hour drive to the Afro Circus</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time we got there, I could hardly contain my excitement.We grabbed a few bags of popcorn and leisurely stalked to our seats. As we nonchalantly chatted away, we didn't notice the ringmaster come out. Suddenly, the crowd stopped talking as the ringmaster talked about the acts. The show was about to start!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first act started a few moments after the ringmaster left. An acrobat named Tom came out and did some flips that seemed impossible to human kind! As the acts went by, I watched every one intensely. One of my favorite acts was when a clown juggled on a unicycle while holding a beach ball on his nose. My all time favorite act happened at the end of the show. By then, I felt like anything was possible. For the end of the show, a performer set a ring on fire, and had a tiger jump through it! I watched wide-eyed as the crowd went wild.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we left the circus, I longed to see more. I asked my parents if we could come back. They thought about it for a moment and said, &quot;maybe another time.&quot; As I think about all the circuses I have been to, I always think the Afro circus was the best of them all. You're probably wondering how this circus got it's name now. Why, that's because all the performers wore a rainbow colored Afro on top of their heads!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023153118	562	2		20131023161902	539	2

My names Ruben and I am a tamer for the circus. I realized I wanted to be a tamer when I was 7 because I went&nbsp; to see the circus. Then I saw the tamer come out with a huge lion, and the lion did what the tamer said. So I went home and told my mom that I wanted to be a tamer. She told me,&quot;If I wanted to be a tamer I would have to practice all day every day.&quot; She really didn't want me to go to the circus, but she knew it was my dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm 11 now and I've ben in the circus for 2 years. I've loved being in the circus but I haven't performed yet. But I can't be sad because today is my birthday and my friend Travis said he'll give me my present before tonights show. I've been wondering if I could ever perform in the circus? But everyone says I can't becauger thse I'm younger then them. I asked Travis if he could tell me what he got me for my birthday, but he wouldn't tell me. So he kept practicing for the circus, but I never knew what he does in the circus. He said,&quot;That it was one of the biggest jobs in the circus, so I started of what his job could of been. I thought that he could of been the conductor, but I knew he was to young to be the conductor. But all the other jobs were aready taken so I thought he just helped around the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 4 hours before the circus started and Travis still hasnn't gave me my present, and I couldn't find him. So I just went to help other people get ready for the circus. It's 30 minutes before the circus starts and everyone is ready for the circus but Travis. But then I heard Travis's voice really loud then I figured out what his job is. He was our new announcer! Then he said to the croud,&quot;Please welcome our new tamer Ruben!&quot; Everyone cheered for me as I came out of the back and I saw 100's of people all staring at me. I've never been more scared but excited in my whle life! So if you ever wonder what its like to be in the circus, remember it might be hard but in the end it's always worth it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END</p>	2		20131024102315	693	2		20131024113951	556	1		20131025143543	543	2

When it starts a boy or girl will welcome you to the circus and it will begin. The first act will come out and do what they are practicing before the show. When they are done the audiance will clap and then the next act will come on.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the act is done there is a break so you can get food and the acts can relax and wait for the the break to be done. When the break is done, they will welcome you back then the next act will come on. After that act the last act will come on. Then when its done all of the staff will come out and bow. When the show is done you can take pictures with the acrobats and the clowns.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This is what you can do in a circus if you go. When you go, it can be scary when the tightrope walker goes on the rope but it is fun to watch.

Doing the stunts that we do in the circus takes time to learn. You also have to be very fit to do these things and you deffinatly need to have rock hard abs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Doing these stunts in the circus may get you injured but atleast you aren't just sitting on the couch with a pizza in one hand and a soda in the other, you are out having fun. To be in the circus it takes time, dedication, and you have to believe in yourself. Being in the circus we get to see alot of wild animals but the best thing is doing all of the stunts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I have always wanted to stay in the circus because it is to fun to leave it. Although we have 10 shows a week I love it. I know I might get to old in a couple of years to be in the circus but I can always sit in the audience and watch.

As I was walking I happened to see a poster that said &quot;Circus in town, get your tickets before its to late!&quot; I was so exited I went right home and told my mother. Unfortunately my mother didn't like the circus. I begged her and told her it would be at a fair, finally she said yes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a week from now but I was still so eager. I bought three tickets one for me, one for my friend, and one for my mother just in case she changes her mind. It was Friday now and tomorrow was the show. I could barely sleep soon I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up it was already 8:05 and the show started at 8:00! I was late!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quickly woke up my mother and we drove off it was 8:09 we made it there with just enough time to meet Daisy. I begged my mom one more time and told her I bought her a ticket, she said yes. It turns out the show was also running late we made it just in time!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show was amazing it had acrobats, monkeys, clowns, juggling,elephants, and so much more. It turns out my mom loved the performance she was cheering and clapping the whole way though it! afterwards we played many games at the fair I even got a goldfish! When it was 9:00 P.M. I headed home.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said goodbye to Daisy and went to bed.

You could also train on a special talent that you excell at. In the circus, you wake up at sunrise and go to bed at sundown. Also if you are a kid traveling with the circus, you have to go to school in a one room schoolhouse that travels with the circus. After school, you have a break before practice for the actual circus. After practice, you have dinner. After dinner, the real circus show begins.People go on unicycles, go on horses, swinging acrobats, yelling hyenas, and dancing elephants. After the show, all the circus preformers, clowns, animals, and kids go to sleep in their trailers. By then, it is past sundown. The next day, they will be either be having a regular day or they will be traveling to an other city, or state, or country, or continent. Maybe someday you will grow up to be a circus preformer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023153118	562	2		20131023161902	539	2		20131025140358	543	2

Even though living in the circus seems really fun, it is also really hard work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today I got the chance to perform with my family members. I got to walk the tight rope. I trained the whole day and I did did it. I would walk&nbsp; across a tight rope and then, clilmb down and do a flip from a trampoline on the one of the horses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tonight was the night of the performance. I was walking the tight rope. I thought I was doing good, then I fell off. I landed on one of the horses and she was very startled. She bucked me off and I dived into a pool of water.

She had been performing in the circus since she was very young. She loved to perform in front of audiences<b> </b>and wasn't very shy. She rode in trailers to go to new places and was usually busy when she was going to perform that day. Her mind was also very full on the days she had to perform because she was always trying to remember her performances. But every year she is always very excited to perform.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year when Lizbeth performs she is excited when she goes to California because she gets to see her friends who live there. When she is there Lizbeth also has time to hang out with her friends when she has time. Sometimes they even stay a little longer so she can have more time with them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lizbeth and the rest of the circus performers visit California they usually do the same type of theme,which is animals. Here is one of the schedules Lizbeth did while in California:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00 A.M. They all wake up,get dressed, then go eat breakfast. While they go to the breakfast are there are circus people already setting up the area for the performance.<br> The area is green with some trees surrounding it. Everything they are setting up is red and white. We sometimes help them set up some things if we have some spare time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:00 A.M.- 3:00 P.M. Lizbeth has school, it is kind of like a regular school. The school goes everywhere they go since they don't spend much time in one place for Lizbeth to go to school. She learns almost the same things other people learn at other schools, but she learns about performing and other things about the circus the most at school.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:00 P.M. Lizbeth's school is finally over she gets some time for free time. For her break she sometimes practices for her&nbsp; performances. Lizbeth also sometimes plays with some of the equipment there. Some of the things she does would be to juggle, play with her pet cat, Fluffy, or just watches some of the circus animals. She sometimes even gets to go hang out with her friends.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 P.M. Lizbeth practices some more for her performance until she thinks she has had enough practice. Lizbeth is going to be involved on riding a horse her performance. She very happy because she loves to ride horses. For that performance it will mostly be about horses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:00 P.M. Lizbeth and the rest of the members eat a little bit of dinner, then they get ready to perform.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 P.M. They wait a while while everyone is entering. Lizbeth takes a peek to see if she sees her friend, which she does, and she is very excited to perform.There are many lights there but as the show starts the lights lower just a bit. They all enter riding a horse. Lizbeth's horse is white with some brown spots. As she looks at the audiences she smiles big at her friends.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:30 P.M. The show is finally over everyone just wants to go back to the trailers and rest. While everyone is getting ready to sleep Lizbeth is just thinking when she will see her friends again.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, Lizbeth was very happy to see her friends in California and can't wait to go next year again!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023132129	935	2		20131023161807	556	2		20131025130823	539	2

We are a part of the circus called the Luoma Circus. Every week we perform at least 7 shows, each one in a different town. I love performing as a circus acrobat but there are some different ups and downs of the circus life. We have to stay up late and rise early, plus amongst all of the commotion the children still have to go to school. I also have chores which aren't so bad because I get to work with different animals that most people don't get to see. Another good thing is that I get to travel around the world and see many places and meet different people who speak different languages. I guess overall I really like the circus life and think that it is better than regular everyday life. If you want to join the circus do it quick because it is lots of fun!</p>	2		20131023162731	562	2		20131023201708	541	2

We were setting up our tents and as we were doing so a family came up.&quot;We are the Jeuffers and we would like to buy front row seats to spectate your circus, Cirque De Lo, and its acts.&quot;As I heard that, I shivered. I just knew they were inspectors. If they gave us a bad review, the circus would be ruined.&quot; Okay sir. &quot; I took the money and gave them their tickets. Hopefully, they wouldn't come for the matinee. And then they were off, as quick as a blink of the eye. I called David, our lion tamer, over and told him about the inspectors. He looked scared, and may I remind you he was a lion tamer, so he called the owner.The owner, whose name is Lou, warned everybody, all the clowns, acrobats, tamers, and all the rest. &quot;We better make a really good show tonight for if we do horrible we go out of business!&quot; yelled out Lou. And that didn't take a nanosecond for everybody to get practicing. I was just watching, for I just sold lemonade and tickets. The show was going to be a spectacular. Everybody looked so graceful practicing, but I,Timmy, just knew something was going to happen. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As the day went on, the tent got fully set up. Dawn was coming and everybody was on their toes. &quot;Everybody it's showtime!!&quot; exclaimed Lou, who look like he wasn't scared, but everybody knew he was shaking inside. Then dawn came. Cirque De Lo was about to start. The Jeuffers were the first people to come.Then everybody else came. We started with are opening act with the clowns doing jokes and skits. Then we showed our four graceful acrobats, Trixie, Daisy, Melissa, and Dave. They did amazing stunts in the air and on the ground. Then, they came out with all of them combined, with a pyrotechnic end.The review from the Jeuffers was &quot; Wow!&quot; and &quot;Amazing!&quot; The Cirque De Lo became a big hit. We got even more costumers from that point. A couple years later, a fire broke out and Cirque De Lo became a end.

Lizzy lives an amazing life at a circus. She got to travel around the world. She see's many different places that have very different people with interesting cultures. Another thing about Lizzy is that she has a best friend that performs with her. Her best friend is a white tiger named&nbsp; &quot;The amazing Tortellini.&quot;.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lizzy and Tortellini do a very fun act in the circus. They do a trick&nbsp; where Lizzy rides in on two white horses. Tortellini is stuck in a cage on the other side of the area being laughed at by three clowns. Lizzy dodges a number of different obstacles and jumps of off the two white horses. she land on a big rubber ball and works her way over to the cage. When she gets there she jumps off of the ball sending it forward and knocking out the first clown. then she uses karate on the other two. She saves the tiger and the crowd go's wild. She often does photo's after each act.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; one day Lizzy got out of bed and went to see Ttortellini but, he wasn't there. she asked the worker that was on cage duty if he knew where the tiger was but he didn't. She looked every where and asked every single worker that she possibly could if they had seen the tiger. They all let her down. The next day her parents,(who were clowns putting on all their makeup for the big shoe tonight), let her go to town. She hung posters up all over town. Soon the news about the missing tiger was every where even on the news. the animal catchers were every where, patrolling the city, dart guns in hand. Lizzy decided to go search for the tiger her self.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In just seven days she had been to three different states looking and asking people about tortellini. In approximately two months she had been to two different country's and to so many different states that she lost count, and she still had no sign of the tiger. Meanwhile back at home, Lizzy's parents had sent out three search party's every day, three times a day. they were worried sick about their little girl.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A couple of months later , Lizzy had made it all the way from AAustin Texas, to some where in London. She had not even seen a hair from the soft, furry, coat of the white tiger. &quot; It's like he just dissapeared.&quot; She thought. Then all of the&nbsp; sudden some thing knocks her over from behind, and starts licking all over her face.&nbsp; When the licking finally stopped, Lizzy looked up and saw some thing that was very unexpected.&nbsp; Tortellini was standing right in front of her looking as happy as could be. &quot; Tortellini!&quot; screamed Lizzy. &quot; I thought I'd never see you again!!!&quot; And Lizzy took her best friend and went home.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After about five months of walking, jogging, and running, Lizzy and the tiger finally made it back home. Lizzy was thinking about how her parents were going to act when they saw her. Were they going to ground her for the rest of her life? Were they going to make me clean up elephant poo for a month or two? Well there's only one way to find out. She thought. So she tied Tortellini to a post and went into her parents trailer.&nbsp; As soon as her parents saw her they jumped up and gave her a giant hug. They told her that they missed her so much and how they wouldn't let the circus go on without you. They also told her how they new that she would find her way back home because she was such a determined young lady. But the two things they didn't do was ground her or make her clean up the Elephant poo.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lizzy grew up and started a circus of her own. She had a lot of animals and people doing very different acts. but the best act out of all of them was the one including a little girl and her best friend. The white tiger.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;<b>The end</b></b></p>	2		20131023131502	537	2		20131023150911	690	1		20131025131342	543	2

Me, Kautious McNeil, loves working at the circus. Me and my family live in a gigantic mansion. We travel all over the world every 6 months. We visit 250 cities each year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the time I get up every day to work:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 A.M. I get up and brush my teeth, wash my face , take a shower and get dressed.Then I go to the kitchen to get some pancake and sausages.We all setup the lights, the tents, adn music for tonight.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:30 A.M. is school time, I get all of my books and things for school. Then I put inside my bookbag just in case I need it for school. Just like any other kind of school we had computers, desks and ect. Because, I was a circus performer all over the world, some of my classmates had different languages:Chinese, Japinese, Russian.</p> <p>The more we would travel the more I would learn about it in school.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 P.M. it is dissmissal time in school, meant that it was time to go home. The clowns let me ride their small cars and their juggling balls. I also played with my puppy,Pluto. Now its almost time for me to practice for the circus. so i put up Pluto and began to clean up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 P.M. dinner time now. after I have finish dinner, now it's time to go to the show. We do a show every saturday and friday.</p> <p>now the show is over at&nbsp; 10:45 P.M. I am so tired now, I am so ready to go home and get in the bed and go to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:30 A.M. Now I am in bed. I'm dreaming about becoming a acrobat this time. I can not wait until it is time for the touring season. I cannot wait until we go to Flordia for the summer break. Still when I grow up I want to be an acrobat in the circus. Do you think that will happen? It's still tough, busy, and fun just like always.</p>	1		20131022092732	935	2		20131022120057	537	2		20131023111805	552	1

If not well don't worry today I'll tell you all about the circus. I'm Jane Parks I'm originally a Circus Acrobat from Circus Town you may or may not have heard of it but I travel all over the U.S. My mother and father Mr and Mrs Robin and Mike Parks Travel with me. They're also in the circus. My mother is a tightrope walker, and my father is a circus juggler, but lets talk more about the circus and not about me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus is a terrific place. We travel about 20,000 miles every year, you think that's a pain in the neck take a look at my schedule below.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's my schedule:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00 A.M. - I get up brush my teeth and my hair get dressed and go down to the pie-car to eat breakfast while the crew sets up for tonights performance. (The pie-car is where circus performers go to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner.)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:30 A.M.-2:30 P.M. - Time for school. Our school isn't that big it's a one room school house but we still have just about everything regular schools have like computers, tests, report cards and reading logs. Sometimes as we travel we perform with people that don't speak our language like once we were performing in Mexico and most of the students in my class spoke Spanish, I know a little Spanish but not enough to communicate with them so I just stayed quiet.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:00 P.M.- School is over. This is usually the time to take a break and relax and play with friends or pets. I usually go to play with the my dog Snowball.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 P.M.- 6:00 P.M.- At this time I would probably be doing daily chores and practice. I water, feed, and groom the three horses that we perform with. Then I have to put the head and body piece on the elephants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 P.M.- Time for dinner. Before our show we go back to the pie-car for dinner, but don't eat to much because after dinner we perform and the last thing you want is to get a stomach ache in the middle of the show, trust me its happened to me before.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00 P.M.- Getting ready for the show as I put on my performance suit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:00 P.M. - Show is over the day is done. I am exhausted and ready to fall back on the bed and go to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:00 A.M.-In bed ... falling .......asleep... Zzz... sorry dozed off there for a second. Well I better end this before I doze off again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well there you have it, a nice little schedule about what happens in the circus everyday. I'm getting a little tired myself I better hit the hay before I fall asleep too.</p>	2		20131024113951	556	2		20131024140601	935	2

Also if you get accepted you must train and folow the instuction they give you to do.And you also have to keep practice with a asistant or partner to make sure you done it right or everyone that is watching will laugh and your boss will be mad. If you keep on trying you would probably make the audiance go wow , cool, and how did they do that.But with hard work you probably wont even get booed off the stage . And for my opinon i think being a circus performer is actuall hard thatn you think .But to the circus performer who practice it probably isn't challenge .But with the hard work you can and will get accepted to be a circus performer, and you would reach your goal.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022205646	545	1		20131023132128	935	1		20131024222350	543	1

So like your dad might uses somersaulting off a running horse.You would work on leaping on a trampoline onto the horses back, it takes a lot of balance and concentration.The others are then practicing juggling and acrobatics.Their neighbors walk baby leopards on a leash.The other trainers are working with the animals such as elephant,lions,and chimpanzees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6:30 It is dinnertime and the family and they go to eat at the pie car, but they don't really eat much because they are performing and they might do flips and they don't really want to bommet.If you work at the circus you have to work 10 shows a week so if you are going to be a circus person it might be tiring.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 when the show is over you might be wiped out and you have to walk it back to your trailer passing the circus office,conssesion stands, stables and trailers.Then two days from there they would go to another town and setup.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 12:00 you take a shower and think about how you did in the touring season. You might want to move back to your hometown where you were born.Then you go to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you grow up you may want to be a circus performer and think it will be fun but it may also be a hard challenge because you have lots of things to do&nbsp; in the morning throughout the night and get to have a little sleep.The circus is fun but is a busy and a tough life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022165050	562	2		20131023130534	537	1		20131025100228	552	2

Although most people think that being in the circus is an easy job, they're wrong. I have a very busy schedule. I'm occupied for most of the day.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, I go to the pie cart and eat breakfast (7:00 A.M.) then I go to school at 9:00. I learn geography and math today. Soon, my geography lesson will come alive when we move to another city. At three school is over. I get a break for awhile. I get to ride on the unicycles and juggle, but soon my break is over. At three thirty I go do my chores and practice, I groom the horses and give them oats and a bucket of water. I have to keep my skills up so I can do the shows.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hours later at six thirty I go get dinner with my family. We don't eat too much because we have a show and don't want to get cramps. I go to the main circus tent and get ready for the upcoming show. Lights. Camera. Action. The stage comes to life as everyone moves about. I brace myself and do a triple back flip of a diving board into a tub full of water. As I do this I think that it's really strange that my parents want me to do circus. They never get worried that I would fall or sprain an ankle, or even break a bone! I wonder why. Is it because they believe I have something for circus and I'm very talented? Or maybe they're just careless. Whatever the case they don't worry that I'll fall. I come out of the water and a lion jumps over my head. The crowd cheers. I leap out of the water and run up a ladder. A tightrope comes into my field of view and my heart starts thumping. This is my favorite part. I start walking across the tightrope. I pretend to lose my balance halfway through. The crowd gasps. Just as it seems I'm going to fall I grab the rope with my feet and lift my arms up to pull myself across. I get off the ladder at the other end and leap onto a horse that then throws me right onto another horse. That horse throws me up in the air and I come falling back to the earth, but, a lion comes and breaks my fall. I get off and take a bow. The crowd goes wild. They talk with each other and make gestures with their hands.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the performers go back to there trailers. I'm exhausted, but I can't wait until the next show. Now it's ten thirty so I go back to my trailer. On the way there are lots of venders and booths, but most don't have anyone in them. When I get back to my trailer I plop down on my bed, exhausted. I can't wait until the next show. I think about how in two days I'll be leaving this city and move to the next. I drift off to sleep on a matter of minutes.</p>	2		20131023130535	537	2		20131023200047	545	2

When i first heard of a circus i thought it was just a bunch of random people dancing and singing but when i finally saw it my chin dropped it was the most amazing thing ive ever saw. After that day i kept on waiting intil the circus came to my town again. Some people think that we work hard and they forst and beat the animals i the circus to do what we teach them but we dont we keep practicing it with the animals til they can do it right.

I travel on the road with 100 people who are like a circus family to me, who are with me the whole time. When you're young, it's the time to do it. It's the time to travel, the time to grow and experince your life. Philippa also gets a thrill from performing in front of&nbsp; a live audience. I get to play and have fun every night. It's great to see the faces of the audience just jump alive when I make eye contact with them during the performance. You can see the audience being transpoterd to antother world.

I love alot about the circus but my favorite thing about it is performing!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing that I don't like about the circus is that there are alot of long tiring days. You are away from home alot. You also don't see your family alot either. The only thing that you really think about is the show that night.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus is really fun! Don't let the down sides keep you from trying out the circus. You would probably have alot of fun if you were in the circus.

I look out the trailer window to see the birds are still chirping for the sun to rise and I can smell the sent of pancakes and bacon coming from the pie car. My favorite! I run over to dad's bed and tug his covers off with a rip. Oops, i probably shouldn't tell him about that, good thing he was asleep. I walk away like nothing happened, suddenly i hear a loud roar. Uh oh was a lion loose. I turned around to see my dad was the one making all that noise. Seriously. &quot;Somebody was bugging me in my sleep!&quot; my dad says loudly. I start laughing so hard I fall over. He does this almost every morning, it's hilarious. We walk over to the pie car and gobble down our breakfast. School starts at 9:00 A.M. so i have to get ready fast. In our school people speak different languages. Another thing cool about our school is that as we travel on tour for our circus our social studies lessons come to life. 3:00 P.M. School is over and I get to play around a bit with the clowns. This is the only free time I have during the day. 3:30 P.M. and it's time to practice my act. Today I am practicing jumping from a trampoline onto a horses back. My dad is practicing somersaulting off of a running horse. 6:30 P.M. is when dinner comes around I can't pick out the sent of what the cooks are cooking, but I know it is something light on our stomachs because we can't eat to much before the night shows. Today especially because it is a Wednesday and we have a matinee after the main show. We go through the show with no problem. During the show it is fun to see the audience come alive with you and your acts. 10:30 and the show is over I am wiped out. It is late at night now and I'm thinking if I will stay in the circus like my parents or not. &quot;The circus sure is fun,&quot; I think to myself, &quot;but it can definitely be busy and for sure tough.&quot;</p>	2		20131021103318	537	2		20131021124637	935	2		20131021232650	543	2

It is my dream to dance with them. They do every type of dance from hip-hop to ballet. They can even dance on top of horses. They are so cool personaly they are the best act in the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always sit in on their practices and some times they even teach me things and maybe they will let me become an honorary member of their group.The one thing about the circus is that you never really have a normal life. I barly have any friends and you are never good enough to do the act you want to. but guess what&nbsp; I talked to my dad and he said that I could be an honorary member of their group.

Not everyone can be in a circus and if you are going to be in one you need to know that your scudele will be filled. Every minute counts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your morning will be similar to this. You wake up at 7:30 get ready and eat your breakfest while the other staff sets up the tents and other things for tonights show. If your a chiled around 8:30 is when you go to school and learn about things any other student would along with the history of the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School is done at about 3:30 and i help out with the chores and rehersal. I tend the animals by feeding them, bathing them, and getting them show ready. At rehersal we go threw all the acts and make sure everything goes smoothly. Finnaly at 6:00 sharp the show starts and we perform in front of our audience of 600 people. Let the show begin!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 8:00 the show is done and we are all tired. We eat a big meal then shut all the lights of and wash all the makeup on our faces. Im in bed by 11:00 and I think about the show and my home back in Arizona.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its 7:30 and I am ready for another day at the circus.</p>	2		20131022161159	935	2		20131023131555	693	1		20131025095714	543	2

Maggie had been in the circus for a long time but she had never been in a show before. This was her day and she was determined to make it perfect. If she messed up she would promise herself never to go into public again.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got herself dressed into her nicest clothes and decided to go out into the fresh morning air. Once she got outside she ran over to the gym to practice her part in the show. When she got there she noticed her dad was already there practicing tightrope walking.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she walked in she startled him and made him fall. She wasn't afraid for him though because she knew her father was a great acrobat too. She watched him fall and then bounce off air as he grabbed the rope to stop himself from falling all of the way.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, the night of the show, Maggie was more nervous than ever. She kept on trying to run back to her camper but her dad stopped her every time. Maggie had to be an acrobat and didn't want to have to do that in front of millions of people because she was afraid she would mess up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was finally her turn and she went out onto the stage. She jumped up onto the rope and started to climb as high as she could. Then she started to swing the rope and hung upside down while it was swinging. She heard ooh and aah as she did the rest of her part without any mistakes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end she was so relieved that she had done it right she decided she wanted to be in the circus forever. Even though she did make mistakes sometimes, Maggie grew up to be a famous acrobat.</p>	2		20131022120126	562	2		20131022161325	556	2		20131024125622	552	2

Its also really cool because you get to see animals do amazing tricks and you might even laugh if there's something funny.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I went to a circus ones and i in joyed it My favorite thing there was the acrobats people. The circus itself looks unique because its shaped like a tent, most building look just square. In a circus there are clowns,lions,tigers'acrobats people, and more. If your in a circus you mught have to work 7:00 when you wake up to 9:00 when you go to bed!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>And in a circus its not just doing tricks you have to feed and take good care of the animals. And even when your traing it can be lots of fun. So next time theres a ticket or a poaster to go to the circus you should use it. :-)</p>	1		20131022161304	541	1		20131023133153	562	1

Here a typical day for me:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:00 A.M.&nbsp;</p> <p>I wake up,get dressed,and go to the pie car (1) for pancakes and bacon. The crews are setting up tents,lights, and music for tonight's show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:00 A.M. School time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our one-room schoolhouse travels with us. Like any school,ours has computers,tests, and report cards.Because the circus performers are from all over the world, many of my classmates speak other languages:French,Russian, and Italian, like my family. As we travel around the country, our geography lessons come alive.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3:00&nbsp; P.M.&nbsp; School's over.</p> <p>school's over-time for quick break. The clowns let me play with their unicycles(2) and juggling balls. I also play with my tiny dog, Noble; our trailer is too small for a large pet. I'd like to join a soccer team, but we're never in one place long enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 P.M. Chores and practice.</p> <p>I feed, water, and groom(3) the horses we use in our horseback acts. Today, my dad practices somersaulting off a running horse. I'm working in leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back; it takes balance and concentration.Other kids are practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leopardson a leash. Trainers are working with elephants,Lions, and chimpanzees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 P.M. Dinnertime.</p> <p>My family and I go to the pie car to eat , but we don't eat that much because we're preforming tonight. We do 10 shows a week: one each weekday,plus a matinee(4) on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and tow on Sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:30 P.M. The show is over.</p> <p>I'm wiped out(5). Walking back to our trailer, we pass the circus offices, concession stands, stable, and trainers. Two days from now, we'll all set up in another town.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:00 A.M.&nbsp; In bed.</p> <p>I'm thinking about the end of our real home in Florida. When i grow up, will i still be a circus performer like my parents? Who I still be a citrus performer like my parents? Who knows? The citrus is fun, but it's a busy and tough life.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how you can be a circus performer go to htt://WWW.kidzworld.com/article/4481-becoming-a-circus-performer</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Becoming a Circus Performer</u></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever dreamed of running away from&nbsp; home and joining the circus? Think you have what it takes to be a acrobat or a trapeze artist, you think you have what it takes? To find out some of the ins and outs of becoming a circus performer, <b>kidzworld&nbsp;</b> spoke with Philippa Handball, an acrobat and dancer with Cirque du Soleil's circus,<b> Quidam.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Circus Performers - Getting Started</u></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone can get in the circus and become an acrobat or a trapeze artist. You have to have the right body type and a specific talent. When Philippa's was five years old she stared in the circus. She did&nbsp; Ballet , and&nbsp; musical theater and all kinds of music, singing, acting and home craft. When Philippa was 11 years old she know what she want to be when she grow up a performer. So, she went for it. She gave up everthing else and concentraed&nbsp; on her way for dancing and performing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>Circus Performers - The Upside </b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippa got the change to go travel the world.&nbsp; she go to see many different places and meet many different people. she traveled with 100 people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>Circus Performers - The Downside</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus is not high-flying fun and games and clowing areund, but it is more than&nbsp; just fun and ggames you have to work hard every day. But you can have some fun but you have to work. The circus you have to send time away form home. You have to do shows on the&nbsp; weekdays and on the weekends. You do not get to seeyour family. You have to work long hours and weekends as well. You have to want it if you want to be a perfomer because you do not get to&nbsp; see your family and you have to work long house.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;BY: KAMRON A CHESEBRO-FILDS</p>	N		20131023164428	562		N	20131024102108	539		N

They open their sleepy eyes and stare out at their magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower. The sun is just coming up and is peaking through the holes of the Eiffel Tower. The crisp autumn air fills their lungs as a breeze enters through their open window. They drag themselves out of bed and into the bathroom. They are in a circus in Paris, France and are the famous twin trapeze artists with an act called Fire and Ice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half an hour later they are roaming along the cobblestone streets of Paris looking for their favorite chocolate shop, A Dream in Chocolate. Finally they spot the chocolate shop. It has old stone walls, a wooden door, a small sign above the door with fading purple paint, and three stone steps that lead up to the shop. It has a strong aroma of cocoa that you can smell from a mile away. They walk up the steps and into the shop. The store is amazing! It has rows of truffles, chocolate eggs, chocolate bark, chocolate hearts, chocolate covered strawberries and more all sorted by milk chocolate, white chocolate , and dark chocolate. The twins walk up to the counter and order their favorite, dark chocolate hot cocoa with milk chocolate truffles dipped in it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they finish the hot cocoa they sneak back into the circus arena. They are not supposed to eat at chocolate shops, they are supposed to eat at the circus's pie car. At 8:30 they rush the circus's school where they learn French, English, Math, Spelling and much more. They listen to their teacher drown on and on until finally at 1:00 schools over. They walk to the circus arena to start practicing. The circus arena is a large tent rainbow colored with bright gold stars and flashing colored lights. During the show it is where everyone preforms, where all the seats are, and where they will be selling sickly sweet cotton candy that dissolves in your mouth faster than any other kind and buttery popcorn that smells so good you just can't resist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James and Lily harness up and practice dancing through the air, flipping and catching each other. Finally it is time for the real show. James and Lily watch eagerly as other people preform tricks with lions and juggle swords until finally the announcer calls, &quot; And now introducing the fantastic, the amazing, the thrilling, Fire and Ice!&quot; James and Lily hold their poses as they get hoisted up into the air , then finally the break their poses and burst into a scene of dancing a flipping and spinning in mid air so magical that it transports you to a different world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 the show is over and James and Lily get out their costumes and curl up into bed until tomorrow when they wake up and go through the routine all over again.</p>	2		20131022105344	539	2		20131022120057	537	2

It takes talent to be in the circus and mom says that is what i got.&nbsp; I am extremly nerveous because I have to stand on chairs, and ride across on a unicycle, and walk across on my hands. I am pretty good at that but I just think I might fall off if i get distracted.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are almost ready to leave for the big tent.

I took the phamphlet and looked at where the circus was. I was pretty good doing flips and somersaults I thought if I joined the circus I could go all over the continent. I registered to practice and see if they'll hire me. Next, it was my turn to perform for the judges. I said to myself quietly &quot;I can do this&quot;. I did some cart wheels then a somersault, jumped on trapoline then flipped in the air. Then the judges talked for a couple minutes and said that I was hired to do the circus. I had to pack my stuff to go on the world tour</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way I packed my clothes and things I needed and things that I could remember about my family. I took my suitcase outside and said good bye&nbsp; to my family I thought to my self if&nbsp; I really want to do the circus or stay here with my family. I went to the person who was in charge of the circus I was hired to. Then I asked hime if I could my family a few times a year here and they said only once a year or twice a year. I told him that I'd like to do that so I could come visit my mom and dad and my sisters. I was really excited because I LOVED traveling but I love my family too. But I would send the some of my money that I earned from performing in the circus to my family so they'll remember me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and some other people from the circus got to go to Japan, Australia, Wisconson and lots of other places. I stayed as a circus performer to earn some money and have some fun with it I also got to visit my family. It was really fun to do this job because you get to learn about each other and it's like my circus family on my trip. We stay'd together on our tours we were never left behind or been mean to each other. It was a fun time doing this and having more friends but I had to leave my best freiends behind after I left for the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Monday night I thought to myself I have'nt gotten to see my family and friends in a while I quitted my circus life after 4 years of being in the circus. I missed everyone in my home town and some new neighbors came to move in. I thought I could open a little circus show once in a while with no tours. That means I could live on my dream and stille stay with my family.</p> <p>I hope some of my circus friends come visit me some times. I sure miss them too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The END</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023150036	539	1		20131023153032	562	1

When it came, the performers barely did anything. All they did was jump from one trapeze to the other until they reached the tightrope pole. It was simple as that. I told my friends that I could learn how to that in a couple of hours. As soon as I finished my sentences, I got transformed in to a circus performer! I was in practice, doing the trick I saw the performers doing. I then started doing the trick, but I missed getting onto the first trapeze. I brushed myself off, then tried again. this time I made it to the second trapeze. I realized this would take a while to learn how to do this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got back from the schoolroom (I was about my age when I was in my own body) I learned how much free time I had. About a half hour. At home, I had a few hours of free time. I realized the circus life wasn't so easy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, After a couple hours, I learned the trick. It was just in time, because the show was about to go on! I had a bit of time to eat at the pie car, but only a few minutes. The food was hamburgers. Not the best I've had.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the show, I was after the tigers, and before the clowns. The tigers were a big hit, I got a good bit of applause, and the clowns were a riot. (a good type of riot) After the show, I cleaned up like everybody else. Sure it was quick, but I was wiped out. I got in bed at about twelve thirty (12:30).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, I packed up to go to Belize. Wherever that is. The show was easy, but I really couldn't understand anything. I was part of a South American tour. I went to Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. I wonder why the circus was such a big thing there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus life is a lot harder than I expected. I thought it would take an hour or two for learning the trick, but this was a lot harder than I expected. Suddenly, I turned into myself again! I wondered how it happened how it all happened, but I was happy that I was back in my old body again. I learned that the circus is harder than it looks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned not to underestimate anybody or anything (especially the circus). I tried to explain what happened to my friends, but decided to not tell that. Nobody really knows what happened right then and there. I guess that I froze time or something. Strange!</p>	2		20131021111958	562	2		20131021132625	537	2

My dads and my heart started beeting fast, so we decided to take a break for about 30 minutes and head over to the games. There was this one game that you had to trough a horse shoe around a bottle three times and my dad actually won something for me.

But you know, In a clowning around type of way. I go to school just like you were we learn and play. But I do something you probably don't! I perform!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to perform 10 times a week! Once every week day and twice every weekend day. But it's not too bad. I get to do awesome stuff like tightrope and trapeze and my personal favorite, Horse back riding! Horse back riding is when you do stunts while riding on a horse. And that's hard!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing I get to do is travel. I travel to different places every week! The bad part is I don't really have a place to call home. And I never really get to see my family. Sometimes I wish I was back home when I lived in Kentucky. but then I would never get to see my parents and little sister Hannah. I still just wish my agenda wasn't so crowded.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in conclusion, My life is ruff tough but fun all at the same time.</p>	2		20131022100351	690	2		20131022105950	562	2

I am a very busy circus performer because being in the circus is lots and lots of work. I do many different things at every show. For example,sometimes I do comedy as a clown,train animals to do tricks,flip as an acrobat,and most of the stuff you usually see in the circus. Today, I'm in the trailer lounge,while a show is going on,eating pie and resting because I broke my leg being an acrobat yesterday.&nbsp;So the story is when yesterday my mom and dad were finished riding the elephants while I was dressing up with my older brother , Mike who was a clown that day, in the dressing trailer. When the clowns were finished with their act then it was my turn to perform. So I started of on a tall balance beam flipping and standing on my hands. Then I climbed up a mountainous ladder to a thin rope with a huge net under the rope about 100 feet below and then started hanging off of it with my legs and doing flips with catching the rope again with my hand. On my 6th trick, I tried to do a trick that I've succeeded before where I hold the rope with my mouth and spin in a circle with my body. It was all fun and games when I then noticed that the rope was bigger than the ones I've used before. I suddenly let loose of the rope because it was too big for my mouth and fell to the net painfully on my leg. The good news was that the audience thought that was the end of my act and clapped without noticing my slight tears. But the bad news was that my leg was broken and I tried hard not to limp on my way back to the trailer which had made my leg hurt even more. So it was very hard but, I've still got a show today just being a clown on a wagon while my brother and dad (who are clowns) fall while pushing my wagon. When the act was finished, my brother helped me do chores when&nbsp; a week passed everything was perfect until my mom got pregnant and had my baby brother,Joey. He turned out to be the funniest clown while only being 4 years old. So life as a circus performer is hard&nbsp; but I managed to get through. I wonder what's going to happen next in my circus life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023161808	556	1		20131024102637	541	2		20131025141932	543	2

Grace went to go check it was her&nbsp; best friend who yelled Mary. Both of them worked as acrobats up in the sky high with Jason there best friend.Grace asked &quot;What had happen Mary?&quot; Mary said that someone stole her costume made out of fancy gems. Grace remembered that she had one too and even Jason. There costumes were to be used that night. So she search in the trailer but no where to be found but something didn't seem right in there.Then she found it a small but white glove in there.<b>Who could have a small glove?</b><b>s</b><b>he thought. </b>Then she ran out to see if they stole her costume and they did she couldn't find it no where to be found.By that time it was almost time for the show and still didn't have a clue who could it be.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason still had his costume and the others did but why did they didn't have there costume. A note was flying down to Mary's and Grace's feet Grace picked it was a to do list.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>To do </u><u>list</u></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <br>First get gems <br>Second still costumes <br>Third sell gems <br>Forth get rich  <p>&nbsp;Grace said&quot;I'd seen this writing before but where?&quot; Mary thought and thought but couldn't remember. Then came there answer it was Larry the janitor. He was the one who did it now that they knew they needed a plan.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to try to get the janitor to get the costumes and get him fire. &quot;You know what to do right.&quot; &quot;Yes I do!&quot; said Mary. Mary went to distract the janitor and Grace went in to his office.When he was gone Grace went in his office and fond there costumes she tried to get them. But then came in the janitor and with Mary, he smiled but the evil kind h. He didn't seem worry at all he just was clam and told the girls what he is going to do with them and why. He locked them right in his office and went out with the costumes. Mary yelled&quot;You won't get away with these!&quot; but it was to late he was gone. Grace thought and thought then told Mary that she will climb up in the air vent. That she will go get help and Mary can yell to see if any one can hear her. So they did that it was there only plan they had when Grace got up the vent and fond her way out even though it was gross and dirty. She fond Jason and Larry together talking what they were going to do with the costumes. She hid behind a tree once they got out of the way she ran as fast as her legs could carry. She found out that the show already started and that the ring master (manger) was intruding the aerobatics and Jason still wearing his costume. Grace ran out to the stage and told the audience that Jason and Larry stole there costumes that was valuable. Once Larry and Jason heard they ran to nearest exit they could find &quot;Stop them!&quot; yelled Grace.Then it happened he police came with Mary in front of them. &quot;Mary!&quot;yelled Grace they hugged each other. The manger fired Larry and Jason and they got sent to jail for a year.Grace and Mar got there costumes back and they got to do there show.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022161159	935	1		20131023133152	562	1

I have been in the circus for about 10 weeks now, and I haven't seen my family for a while. I got into the circus by hard work, and dropping everything I did so I could just focus on the circus. There are some down sides to being in the circus. you have to work about 24 hours a day and you almost never get to see your family, but I'm OK here because I have a friend my age named Dan.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I will tell you about my day. It all started at 6:00 am when I went to the pie car to get some breakfast. As usual, me and Dan met up in the hallway. &quot;Are you ready for the big performance tonight.&quot; asked Dan. &quot;I sure am.&quot; I replied. Oh yeah, I forgot too tell you about Dan. He is ten like me, and we are both jugglers. We have a juggling act together and, it will be the grand finale in tonight's show.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Me and Dan finally get to the pie car, and eat our pancake breakfast. We talk about what we should add to our performance. &quot; I think we should stick with the flaming torch juggling act.&quot; said Dan, and I agreed. We had worked on it for a while now and the grand finale was a good time to reveal it.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few hours went by and we were at school. Today, me and Dan just wanted school to be over so we could practice the act, but we still had geography left to do. Geography comes alive in the circus because you study the places you travel to. Mrs. Worm, our teacher, does a really good job of it.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After school me and Dan practice. Practice goes fairly smooth except for one mess ups. In the act, me and Dan are tossing pins to each other. Dan accidentally threw it when I wasn't looking and it hit me in the face. &quot; Sorry Bart, are you OK?&quot; said Dan. I was OK, but I wouldn't have been if the torch was lit!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 7:00, and it is time to start the show! The clowns come out first (Maggie, and James) and get the audience rolling in the isles. Next comes out Phil the tight rope walker, and he rides a unicycle across the tight rope. Next Pablo does an amazing trick where he gets a horse to sit down! After that, Bob the acrobat, did a triple back flip of a diving board into a kiddie pool. Now, its finally our turn. Me and Dan are too nervous too explain. We start to juggle, and we we get into a serious juggling rhythm. Before we know the act is over, we didn't mess up, AND THE CROWD GOES WILD! We did it!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023164427	562	2		20131024102425	690	2

He is the announcer that may not sound very fun but my dad makes it look like fun.&nbsp; When he does the announcing he makes all of these funny jokes.&nbsp; Even though he has told them all to me before I laugh every single time.&nbsp; The bad thing sometimes about the circus is I never get to see family or friends, but I like what I do so I deal with it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get older since im already an acrobat I want to be an even better one when I get older.&nbsp; Maybe one like my mom.&nbsp; She knows how to do everything when it comes to acrobatic things.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp; you understand how fun but hard sometimes the circus can be from my writing.</p>	2		20131022085630	539	2		20131022100442	541	2

You can't just decide you want to go and sign up or audition a short speech. You have to have a purpose, a talent, and you have to be able to have fun and not give up if you do something wrong the first time. When you are in the Circus you have to be ready for an adventure of a lifetime. But first, you have to think if this work fits your personality.</p> <p>There are three very important keys for being in the Circus. Number one, bravery. In the Circus, there are very scary acts that you have to put on for the audience. So you have to work hard to be brave in those acts. The second key is working hard. In a Circus, you have to work really hard and put 100% work into it. The third key is endurance. You have to have a lot of endurance when working in the Circus. Like when you have to work hard, you won't just give up if you mess up.</p> <p>Despite the hard things in the Circus, you can have a really good time. You can acomplish things you have never acomplished before. You also get to go around the world to some really fun places. You can perform really fun things and you can expeirience things that you have never before.</p> <p>So, if you want to join the Circus, you might want to keep this for the times you want to give up and go home.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022120150	556	1		20131022161303	541	2		20131024095142	552	2

So at 9:00 A.M. we all met at her house and went to the circus. &quot;Hey, I am so happy you all could make it,&quot;said Sarah. &quot;Of course, why would we miss it?&quot; I said. We all headed to watch the show. &quot;I am going to get some popcorn,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Okay, butcome back sorton. The show is going to start,&quot; said Megan. &quot;Okay. I will come back soon,&quot; Sarah promised. 30 minutes passed. Sarah did not come back yet. We all suspeccted something. So we left the show and went to find Sarah. So I called Sarah. I heard a cell phone ring near us. It was weird but I knew SArah ws near us. I just couldn't find her. &quot;Hello?&quot; I asked. &quot; This is Sarah. Sorry I did not come back.. I had to um go to the restroom?&quot; she said in a strange way. &quot; Well we are glad you are okay. We thought you were kidnapped or something. Anyways, where are you?&quot; I questioned. &quot;Well, I am near the trash can in front of you,&quot; Sarah said. I looked up. I saw a clown that looked a lot like Sarah. Sarah wsa making balloon animals for little children. She walked toward us. &quot; Hi everybody. It's me, Sarah, your friend,&quot;she said. We all were surpirsed. &quot; Look, I didn't want to tell you all because I knew you would laugh at me. Sorry,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We don't care. We are your friends so we don't care if you are a clown and look silly. We care only about you. We judge on what the inside has. Not the outside. We are your friends so we won't laugh at you,&quot; Megan replied. We all nodded. Then we all shared secrets about ourselves that nobody knew so our friendship would be stronger.</p>	2		20131024112650	693	2		20131024152526	690	2

You probly get home sick. And, when you get the new friends to take place of your old best friends/friends, you find the right person for you, you have to say, &quot;fairwell' because you have to go to another city. Then you miss them and all the other friends that you had to say fairwell to. And it just recycles and recyles till you just say,&quot;Im not gonna make nomore friends because that`s just more friends you have to good bye angain and an again and again because it just will tear me apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another note,think to your self,do I really want that life or do I want a peaceful life and keep the friends I already have and not get home sick and not have to move evry week or even that. That will</p> <p>depress me so so much.and in the story,'life`s a circus&quot;,it said that he/she was wiped out after that day.Plus,it said that he/she went to sleep at 12:00pm and if you want to have a life at a circus think twice about it or think a long long time about in your room or in a quiet place or even, tell your parents or an actor in the circus if it's a good idea and&nbsp; don't take my word for it, tell sombody you khow that is in a circus!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	0		20131023132241	690	0		20131023155408	537	0

When I got to the stables, they were empty! I looked in the makeshift barn and all around, but I couldn't find them! Then I heard a:</p> <p>&quot;Nay!&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I turned around to find both horses standing a few yards away.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>How should I get them in their stables?</b> I thought.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then I see the big box of oats and an idea was born.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>I know what I'll do. </b>I thought. <b>I'll put a trail of oats leading to the stables!

For a circus performer, work can be hard and fun.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun's up and the day has begun. You get dressed and have breakfast at the pie car with the other performers. The crew is setting up for the show. After breakfast you go to school with classmates from all over the world. You learn about geography lessons and whats planned for the long day ahead.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After school you head on out for a break. You can play with the other performers or practice for the show. About thirty minutes later you practice and feed the animals. Whatever act you were assigned you practice and get warmed up. You can also help other performers do their activiy for the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few hours later it is dinnertime. You have a light dinner because of the show. Then you get some practice and head on out for the show. The show has begun and you watch from behind the curtains as the other performers do their act.

John, the anocer began to welcome the audience he talked some more then it was time for me to go back on this time with my friend,sally. We did our acrobat rountine we we hit our pose the crowd cheered. still performing out came Tom and Greg the Lion! &quot;Its a lion!&quot; a kid in the crowd said exictedly. &quot;this is greg the lion folks!&quot; Tom siad pointing to the lion. On my rope i flipped and landed on the ground on my feet of course.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the act the clowns went out on <b><b>unicycles </b></b>and small cars. After a ton of performing the show was over in two days we would be going to a new town to perform. I was very wiped out, before bed i went to the<b> <b>pie car</b></b> to get a snack then i was off to bed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day i woke up got dressed then went to the <b><b>pie car</b></b> to get breakfast. I saw the crew setting up tents and lights and music for the<b> <b>mantinee </b></b>(afternoon show).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 1:00pm i went to groom,feed, and give water to the horses which we use for the horseback acts. At 3 it was time for the <b><b>mantinee</b></b>, which was amazing everyone performed so well. After the show i got ready for the next. When i was in bed that night i was thinking if when i am older i'll still be a circus perfomer. The circus is fun but its tough at times.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021135343	935	1		20131021154559	562	1		20131022144917	552	1

Living in the circus is fun and a great experience,but it can be really tough. We do fun stuff like when we perform. performing in the circus is so fun,but can get tough. you have to practice and stay fit. You don't really get to see your family either. Living in the circus can get complicated.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you first enter the circus you must have a special talent, the right body type, determination, and you have to put your heart into what you're doing. When you are in the circus you get the opportunity to travel the world. You get to go to Australia, Japan, and all over North America. Being in the circus gave me chances to meet new people from all over the world.You become so used to the people you work with that they become your family.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the circus can be fun and gives you amazing opportunities, it isn't all fun and games. You have to work long days and spend a lot of time away from home and your family. On tour you don't really have anywhere to call home. You have to work long hours and work from sunup to sundown. You practice your routine, go to school, you do chores, perform, and go to sleep. The circus isn't all fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus is very fun but has its downside.You must stay fit and healthy for performing. Living with the circus gives extraordinary chances. You get to meet new people and make new friends. Living in the circus gives me amazing possibilities and is amazing.</p>	2		20131022151435	545	2		20131022161326	556	2		20131025091923	539	2

You have to train, perform in many different places, and you live a normal life to. Also, you have to be fit for the job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><b>Benifets of Being a Performer</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus can be fun and exciting if you look at it this way. You will have have one specific job like an acrobat, trapeze artist, lion tamer, working with elephants,jugguling, ride unicycles, and many many other amazing talents that you will have to work with. Being a tapeze artist is my dream. I love to swing, jump, and im very flexiable. I think I wiuld be good at this job, but i have never tried it so I would have to train alot to be a pro. You also have to be brave for some talents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><b>Disadvantages of the Circus</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the disadvantages of the circus is that you wont get to hang out with friends, or learn at school,and maybe even not see your family if they are not in the circus with you. Missing your family can be tough if you are a kid. You can't hang out with friends because you will be training or performing. Also, you be able to learn about social studies, science, writing, or math. you might have a school travel with you so you can learn when you have freetime. But you never know how long you'll be in the circus. You might get tired and want to do some other career, or&nbsp; you might love being in the circus and want to do that for the rest of you life. Also, you might have to put up with the animals and taking care of them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><b>Life Training With the Circus</b></u></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to get up early to train, feed, and get ready for the day. You will have multiple shows in one week and multiple days of moving. Life can be hard when you trainign to be a performer, but it will be worth it. You get to have fun when your performing. Do many amazing, exciting, and fun things while you do you part of the performance but the traing is the hard part. You have to train,train,and train. Hard work for a performer, very hard work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope someday I will be in the circus and get to do some Trapeze and train with the animals. I hope you will consider it too.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	2		20131022211050	537	2		20131023132128	935	2		20131025095714	543	2

Well, that's not quite the truth. I, Rebecca, work at the circus for long hours and weekends, practicing for our next performance in America. The entire circus travels around the world performing for a week.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to become a circus performer, you first have to practice the two skills required, dancing and performing. A girl I know named Philippa, started stardom when she was five years old. She did musical theater, and ballet and all kinds of music, singing, acting and everything to hone her craft. When Philippa wanted to become a performer, she gave up on everything and practiced only the two skills, dancing and performing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I started practicing when I was the same age as her, and coincidentally, we both ended up performing in the same circus. We would practice balancing on a rope for at least three hours, juggle for two hours, and do splits and somersaults until it was bedtime. The next day, we would set everything up for the performance like tents, popcorn machines, rings, and other tools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We'd dress up in our shining costumes, and rehearse until it was time to start the show. Whenever I perform on walking on the rope, I feel like I'm the highest person in the circus, trying to reach the sky while balancing. It ended up with all the circus performers singing and dancing together in front of the audience. The next day, we traveled to a different country and it would repeat all over again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To conclude, I had a fun time and a great eperience traveling all over the world with my friend, performing amazing skills that a normal person can't do. Right now, we're on our way to Moscow, Russia. I hope you'd see me perform one day!</p>	2		20131021111958	562	2		20131021132625	537	2		20131022111032	552	2

There is always five performers, who have been practicing one special act.....but the only thing people know about the act is that it involves many animals. That is why everyone is pushing and shoving each other to get tickets. On the day of the circus, there were people holding popcorn, spilling drinks, and trying to get the best seats. The lights went dim, people froze and sat where ever they were. ''Ladies and gentlemen.... please give a round of applause for our Bellini Circus performers!'' Everyone cheered. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The performers brought out lions, bears, tigers, cheetahs, bulls, elephants, and many more animals. Then, they all climbed onto their backs. Everything was going well until a lion roared. The performer jumped off it's back. Then an elephant stomped, and the bull grunted. All the performers jumped off the animals and called for help. They all looked at each other with confused faces. ''We're sorry folks the show has been canceled.'' As everyone was getting up to leave, they heard a huge bang. The animals had broken loose! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; All the animals ran around the circus, then broke out to the streets. Cars screeched on the breaks. People called 911. Animal control came with big trucks. Some of the animals were caught. others were still missing. It wasn't until 7:00 when reports of animals coming into stores and houses were all the calls police got. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Some people left town. Others.... like the performers, helped catch the animals. After two days some of the animals were still missing. Sometimes when people saw the animals, they would just scream. Most of them were caught, but then the ones that were still missing went into the city and wrecked many things. Soon after that, the town where the animals had first broken loose decided they would let the city take over. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So they did. Three men came and caught the animals. Police tried to figure out why the animals got scared and ran away. they didn't figure it out, but they figured something else out. That the animals at the circus.... were stolen! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; All the performers were arrested and taken to jail. So when the next circus comes to town, watch out. Those animals might just be stolen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023132129	935	2		20131023161807	556	2		20131025130823	539	2

It is very cool that clowns can fit in a small little colerful car that is shape as a wagon.Clowns are very cool at what they do.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SWINGING AS A ACROBAT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Is it a bird is it a plane,NO it is a ACROBAT&quot;!.Acrobats has lots of skills. acrobats are strong and brave and also healthy.the boys and girls will like the skills they have to show.They will fly like nothing even happen.They will&nbsp; do flips they will fly through hoops,they are not scare of how high they are. they are perfect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE EYE OF THE JUGGLER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;look at the rings fly in the air!&quot;said ME.The juggler make things fly,and do you know how they can do they can do this?They have a eyeand reflexes so they can be able to do this all the amazing stuff that they can throw like balls, rings books and elefants.umm i dont think they can throw elefants, that will be really silly they are too heavy it is inpossible to carry one. jugglers are very skillful and talented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; THEIR GOES THE THIGHTROPE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tightrope walkers are amazing.they can walk on a rope it takes years to walk on one.you dont want to fall or broken bones for you people will get a fortune just doing the tightrope.they are amazing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So go ahead and see the circus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022091325	539	1		20131024125813	552	1

Two day from now, we'll be in a different city.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 12 in the morning I'm finally in bed after a grueling day. At the end of the touring season, I will finally be able to go back home, in Florida.

You may wonder,&quot; Did that actor make a mistake on purpose, or was it an accident?&quot; I have been through a similar situation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was Thursday and I was traveling with the circus from</p> <p>Baltimore, Maryland to New York City for the Annual Friday Show.</p> <p>I was so excited because it was my first annual show. I had been working on training the new lemur named Zed. Zed was not a cooperative little lemur. We worked on his dancing, which took alot of time. Now I hoped we would get it right.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Jerry was the seal. Zed hated Jerry. I don't know if they were</p> <p>scared&nbsp; of each other, or they just hated each other when they first saw each other.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We are here,&quot; my boss, Marta screamed. We all jumped out of</p> <p>the trailer and into the set-up tent. &quot;Now,&quot; said Marta &quot;We have come late, so we are not going to have any time to practice. Start getting dressed!!!&quot; No time to rehearse! We were going to fail! Me and Zed got dressed, and I made sure to keep Jerry away from him. Then I took Zed to the waiting room. &quot;What are we going to do Zed?&quot;I asked. After 30 minutes of waiting, it was our act. I took Zed to the stage, which was already set-up for us. Then, I put Zed down, and introduced us. I turned on the music, and we started to dance. Then, I saw Jerry outside his cage. This was not his act? &quot;Jerry,&quot; I said as softly as I could.&quot;Go back!!!!&quot; As soon as Zed heard me say &quot;Jerry&quot;, he jumped out of the ball pit and on to me! Jerry came out, too, and started to jump with Zed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I managed to get the two of them to stop fighting, I stood there, looking so ashamed of myself. Suddenly, a man stood up and cheered. Then everybody cheered! When I got of the stage, I scolded Zed and Jerry for fighting, but also I hugged them. And now, they are best friends. I am happy they became friends that way!!!</p>	2		20131021152206	562	2		20131022092732	935	2

I would like to be in the circus because I would love to tran the anaimals like to jump&nbsp; from high places. And I would love to teach the seals how to jugle. and I would love to preform in front of the crowed.And now i will tell you the dislikes that I have about the cricus .I do not like that they have tto get up so so early. Thats all I dont about the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now that I am done with my story I hope you liked it and I hope you thought it was great.</p> <p>Thats what I like and dislike about the story .

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One day I was watching a show that reminded me about a circus.When I was done watching my show I went to go tell my mom and dad about it.I started telling them and they sat there listing to me. &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I said if I was in the circus I would do flips and ride in a clown car.I would eat chicken ,corn,mash potatoes, and stuffing.Then go to bed with the animals and sleep in hay.Then I would wake up feed the animals then learn how to do tricks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When I was learning how to do the tricks I would fall down 1 time or 2 times but i wouldn't give up no matter how many times I would mess up.When we were done pacting we would have to do a show I was nerves but if I did mess up I new my friends would bail me out.When we were done doing the show we would have to take off our makeup and me and my friends would go out to go get ice cream. &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We would go home and change into our pajamas,eat dinner,feed the animals,make our beds,brush the horses hair.We would have pillow fights and sometimes read.When we were done playing we would brush our hair,brush our teeth,and wash our face to make sure we didn't leave makeup on our faces.The next day was the same but it was still fun. &nbsp;

Being a&nbsp; performer you have to be able to do many things like riding a unicycle or front flipping over a running horse. Well, it takes hard work being a performer or a acrobat in the at about 7:00 AM you have to wake up and eat breakfast. At about 9:00 AM you set up the circus tent and decorations with your fellow performers. At 6:00 PM you have to go eat dinner, but just a little because you have to perform in a couple of minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, at 7:00 you perform at the circus and finally perform with your fellow acrobats and clowns! Flipping, jumping, and even incredible juggling all of you are doing great and the crowd is cheering loud! After many performances and it is finally the end of the tour you will think about going back to your home and rest for a couple of days, you might even even think if your going to keep performing or change to a different job. Late in the night you finally get a very long and slow sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023112547	539	1		20131023131652	693	1		20131025111201	543	2

This week were performing in china. I had never been to china even though I have traveled basically all over the world. This is really exciting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After when i got up and got dressed, it was time for breakfeast.I next went to the school room to trian and learn. Like normal, are school ends at 3:00. We have about six hours of school trianing, it is hard work. Than Finally we have the show. The show ends at about 10:30 and at that day, I'm really tired. But, what we performed today. I'm happy about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I had fun today and I'm happy to have done the circus. It is hard work but fun. I'm at least all ready for another day of the hard work. Now I'm going to sleep dreaming of the circus. Goodnight.</p>	1		20131023161808	556	1		20131023220330	537	1

I practice by doing it on a thin wood plank, then I went to ropes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I fail, I would get fired because the show would be ruined. The audience would get their money back. Good thing I never fell before. I tightrope with fire, crocodiles, and spikes under me. They are just added to make it look more amazing.

The feeling of the wind whipping my long, dark hair back has always been one of the greatest things about working with the circus. I'm supposed to be able to spin halfway around the trapeze, ending in a position where I'm standing on my hands, legs stretched like I'm doing the splits. I'm having a hard time centering my balance over the bar, but suddenly, it just feels completely perfect! That's when I remember that I wasn't supposed to stay like that the whole time, and that I need to make a full circle. Once that's done, I leap down to the tightrope, walk across on my hands, and execute a perfect backflip down to the ground.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Holly, that was <b>amazing!</b> How did you <b>do</b> that?&quot; My best friend, Sammy(her real name is Samantha, but she hates it when people call her that), asked me. &quot;Sammy, I told you a million times, practice using something closer to the ground, and<b> gradually</b> work your way up!&quot; She asked the the exact same question every time I finished a show. It gets really annoying really fast. I never really have time to ask her to stop, I'm always practicing, or doing a show with my family and friends. In fact, I met Sammy while we were doing a show in LA. She's been part of the backstage crew for years! we're both fifteen, and she's had to assemble the big top with the rest of the crew. Believe it or not, she's actually in charge of what goes on down on the floor. She's also in charge of the sound systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ***************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>THWACKTHWACK</b><b>THWACKTHWACKTHWACK! </b>&quot;Mom, is there a deranged woodpecker living by the door that I don't know about?&quot; I laughed. She shook her head. &quot;No, but if you don't hurry up you'll be late for practice.&quot; Sammy's voice shouted, &quot;<b>HOLLY, HURRY UP! IT'S SHOWTIME!&quot; </b>I looked at my watch. &quot;Yikes!&quot; This was my first time performing a big act alone. &quot;Good luck, Holly!&quot; Sammy yelled as I ran to the big top.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024095447	556	2		20131024112709	541	2		20131025150914	539	2

It takes a lot of hard work and dedication but in the end it always turns out ok and you get to do the same act tomorrow and the next and so on.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some times the circus is not so fun and your stuck missing your family. You even have to get up early and go to bed late every night. Setting up the tent and practicing may not be so fun when that's all you do and you want to do more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that's what I have to say about the circus and I hope you get a good understanding</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; about the circus life and what it's all about. the circus is tough and going to bed so late would not be fun for me especially if i was a child and had to go to school and do work with kids that may not even speak my language.</p>	2		20131023220117	537	2		20131024092629	562	2

My dad does lion taming,my mom and my uncle do magic tricks and I do trapeze with my two cousins,Ricky and Jerry.I am the youngest and Jerry is the oldest and Ricky is the middle child.I am 11,Jerry is 17 and Ricky is 16.Finally are the youngest kids and they're are dressed up as clowns and go around in a little remote controlled car tossing out flowers and that's the end of the act.</p> <p>&nbsp; When the show is over I eat dinner and then I go to sleep and the next day I just hit reset on my head.And that is a typical day for me.Practicing is really cool for me</p> <p>probably not if your scared of heights. I just like the feeling of being mid air an doing flips it makes me feel relaxed.We travel around all over the world and we have to learn a lot of new languages and if you don't think that's cool well you are missing out.</p> <p>&nbsp; We am also your average family.We have games we have computers and phones we even have TV.Circus kids aren't any different than your average kids so don't treat us any different than you would treat me if i wasn't in the circus.Me and my cousins also post flyers of our circus.Once we are done with everything we have to do we spend some time to socialize and have sometime to just hangout.Have to stop writing I have a show to perform in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022115945	690	1		20131022164500	693	1

I think being in the circus is hard work because you have to&nbsp; feed the animals, groom the horses etc.Circus performers&nbsp; work long days and spend a lot of time away from home.When their are at tours they they really have anywhere to call home and they always think about the show they are going to o and how its going to turn out.One of the upsides of being the circus is that u get the chance to travel around the world and know new places. Circus performers&nbsp; put their heart into it&nbsp; and that's why people love the circus they put work and their heart to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022100410	545	1		20131022115612	690	1

I am a circus performer. My dad is a tightrope walker and a acrobat. My mother is a acrobat and animal trainer.I help my mother with the animal training. I also do tricks with the horses like jumping from one horse to the other one&nbsp; my mom is on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I am also a acrobat. I love to do flips on wires with my mom. My best friend name is Zeke Wake. He has been my friend since our parents been in the circus. He is also a acrobat his mom is a dancer. He does acrobats with me in the night shows. My schedule is full through the day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The only thing bad about being in a circus is having no time to yourself. There are also a lot of good things like traveling around the world. Also meeting new people every day. I also get to play with the animals every day in their pens. I love playing with the chimpanzees all the time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; I learn stuff that only circus people can learn. Like the history of the land on which we are setting up on. The reason why we came to that place. I love circus school. We get to learn new tricks at this school.This where I learn all of my tricks.We also have a learning school.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; How to become a circus freak is to go to school. You have to be able to some sort of trick. My dad first started out as a clown. Then he was a magician. Now he is a acrobat and tightrope walker. In between all that he has time to hang with me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;When I was little I love to do flips. When I was back home I was in the gymnastics team. I had lots of friends.It was wonderful. One time I did a triple summer salt into the audience. Every one was amazed. The best thing about it is the look on my parents faces.They were astonished.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;I was a cheerleader in 4th grade.It was so much fun. I was always the top of the pyrmid. It was so cool. I thought i could see my house from there. I loved my life at home but, not as much as I love my life now.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The life I have now is the life I would not like to change.Never in my life will I ever change my life. Not even for <b><u>1 BILLON </u></b>dollars.

Once upon time there was a guy named Fred.He loved the circus when it was in town he went to it.He never missed it.so one day at the end of the circus he asked one of the acrobats if he can join the circus,and after waiting about half an hour they finely said yes!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So the next day he got there not a second late.First&nbsp; they taught him acrobatics then they taught him to juggle while on a unicycle then they taught him how to get the elephants to get on a small steel box!Then they told him to get to bed.So Fred said that it was only 7:00!But the manager of the circus said that tomorrow was a busy day then he got the idea.So he went to bed there that night.In the middle of the night he woke up thinking of how busy and tough life in the circus was.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next day he woke up bright and early.When he went in the pie car to eat he smelt a delicious breakfast just waiting for him to get his hands on it!When he saw what it was he went coo-coo it was blueberry muffins!When he finished breakfast it was time for the show!He was so exited!After the show he said that was amazing!

He was surprised that the circus master would ask a boy who is about to turn 11 could flip off of a wire, land on and bounce off of a trampolene, and land on a horse and ride it around the circus rink. &quot;Well, there will be many safety measures,&quot; answered the circus master. Bobby shook his head still mystified. &quot;Go to the pie car and eat Bobby,&quot; the circus master said. After breakfast, Bobby went to school. When school was over he raced back to the circus. Bobby loved basketball. There was a small wooden hoop and a small basketball that Bobby took with him everywhere. Soon he went to feed the elephants. The monkeys needed serious grooming so he set to that too. An hour later, Bobby was done with his chores. Bobby went into the circus arena and started training for his act. The first few times he lost his balance on the wire and fell but soon he was ready to go! At dinner Bobby barely touched his pie. He was too nervous to eat! Soon the circus master announced that the show was beginning. Behind the stage, despite his small dinner, Bobby had butterflies in his stomach and he felt like throwing up! His heart jumped when the circus master announced his name for the act. He entered the arena. Despite the heating, he was shivering. He climbed up the ladder and began to balance on the wire. The crowd held its breath. Then the moment of truth came. Bobby clenched his eyes shutand flipped off of the wire. Bouncing off of the trampoline, he let go of all the excitement he had been holding back. When he opened his eyes he was perfectly landed on the horse. He had done it!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161159	935	2		20131023131555	693	2		20131025095714	543	2

Well, now I can tell you. Many people may think that being part of a circus is very fun, but it has its ups and downs. It is very hard to stay away from home and travel to 150 cities in only one year. Also, to be a part of a circus, you need the right body type, a specific talent, and be very determined. On a typical day, I wake up at 7:00 and sleep at 12:00.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But circus life also is fun. Think about it. I perform every day in front of many people. I practice tricks such as leaping from a trampoline onto a horses back, and also somersalting off a running horse. After school, the clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, being a part of the circus also means traveling the world. I love visiting different places and meeting new people. Of course, that also means that I cannot go back to my home until after the end of our touring season. That is the part that I don't like about the circus. I have to be away from home for seven months each year!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that I dont like about being a part of the circus is that I cannot be a part of any sports teams. We never stay in one place long enough to join any classes, and more importantly, I never have time to join a sports team.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And don't forget, I also have to do chores and pratice my tricks and flips. I feed, water, and groom the horses every day so that they will be clean and ready for the big show. We do 10 shows a week: one each weekday, plus an afternoon show on Wendesday, two on Saturday, and two on Sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know that the circus is fun, but it is mostly a busy and tough life.</p>	2		20131021103318	537	2		20131021132115	935	2		20131021232650	543	2

The act was that the&nbsp; horse was suppose to run and at the right time an acrobat would jump off the trampoline and land on the horse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horses name, Joe, was a hard to train horse. Whenever I tried to make him calm down the horse would either kick me or runaway. It was hard for me to train him, he wouldn't listen.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, I had to train a group of elephants to walk together and stand on their back legs. I had learned my lesson with elephants. The last time I tried to whip the elephant but instead, he barged out to the circus and ran away. This time I was much kinder to the elephant.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after days of practice it was time for the circus. The performer jumped on to the horse, the elephants ran together, and all the other performers did their parts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wiped out after the performance, but now it was time to move on to the next show.

I woke up, got dressed and went to the pie cart.I ate breakfeast and went to school.I was scared for night to come, tonight was the night I was doing my famous trick, I was going to flip off a 70 foot high rope with a dragon in my hand and land on a white horse. The bearded dragon was my pet his name is Peanut. Peanut seemed as scared as I was.I had done the trick before, but at practice what if I mess up, what if everyone laughs at me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I ask my mom and dad to help me practice the trick but both were busy practicing the tricks, I ask my teacher but she says she has no idea what to do to help me with tricks.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was going to be dinner soon and I still had not found someone to help me. I decided to just try to play sick so that I would not have to do the trick, why did I say yes to doing the stupid trick.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to my mom and told her and said, I don't feel good making a sour look on my face.My mom said,&nbsp; ok then let me get you some medicine. I told her that I feel better now.My mom gave me a look and asked me why was I playing sick. I told that I was scared to do my trick,she said it is ok to be scared but I still have to face my fear and do it I told her what if I fall and mess up and everyone laughs at me,it's a circus my mom told me.I suppose I can do it and if people laugh so what it is a circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had already ate dinner and was getting my outfit on, it was blue with white stars.I bradded my hair back.I got peanut and the white horse by the time I got there they were setting up for me to perform.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I climbed the ladder and walked slowly and carefully down the rope.I stood there for a while and then holding peanut in my hand I fliped off the rope and landed on the back of the horse.the crowd cheered.I got off the horse and waved to the crowd, proud of myself&nbsp; I had did it I fliped of a 70 foot high rope.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night I went to my trailor thinking of new daring tricks that I could do for the next show and fell asleep.</p>	1		20131021133557	556	1		20131021222920	541	1

It was because me and my family went to the circus. When my mother told me I&nbsp; was very excited so the next day I got up super early to get ready. Finally we got in the car and left i couldn't wait to get there. I had never been to the circus but I always heard about it from my friends. I would always ask my parents and they would usually say maybe I was so happy today it was a yes!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got out of the car there was a man wearing a tall hat. He welcomed us and asked for our tickets my dad took them out of his pocket and gave them to the man and the man let us in. Right when I walked through the yellow curtains my eyes lit up I saw the juggler and he was on a unicycle! I had always wanted to ride, or even see a unicycle. Then my dad motioned us to our seat. And that was my first memory of my first circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Andrew I am a juggler in the circus just like i had dreamed. When I was 11 (a year after I went to the circus) I asked my parents for a unicycle for my birthday. They must have thought I was crazy because they both stared at each other then back at me. I told them I wanted to try and ride it like the man at the circus. They told me that unicycles were very hard to ride and that the man was a professional, they also didn't want me to get injured but I didn't care.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of getting a unicycle for my 12th birthday I got a set of juggle balls. I thought if my parents weren't going to let me get a unicycle I should learn how to juggle first. At first I tried with two balls, one in each hand. I tossed the right one to the left hand and caught it so I had two balls in my left hand. After I got pretty good at that I tried with three balls but I couldn't do it. The next week I got a phone call from my friend nick asking him if I wanted to come with him and his family to the circus. I asked my mom and she said yes. When I got there we were late so we sat down immediately. During the show when the juggler came out he asked for a volunteer. I raised my hand up high. He closed his eyes and turned around and pointed straight at me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nervously I walked down to him. He told me that he was going to teach me how to ride a unicycle. I got so excited and by the end of the day I could do it, I could ride a unicycle! After the show I still couldn't juggle so I went up to him and asked him if he could teach me, he gave me his card and walked away. Later that night I told my parents everything and asked if I could call the juggler. They said that I could so I did and he said he would give me lessons.</p> <p>&nbsp;And that is how I became a famous circus juggler.</p>	2		20131024135312	539	2		20131024142504	562	2

First of all you have to work really hard you have to wake up early and go to bed late every night. I had ten circus concerts every week, when I woke up me and my famley&nbsp; go to the pie car for breakfest.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One hard thing is that you never can call were you are home, and your never their long anoght to play sports. Plus you never see you famley.</p> <p>The schools had only one room.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Not just anyone can be in a circus you have to be a good dancer, very athletic. And you have to be good with animals an and comfident.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131024113830	935	1		20131025081934	562	0		20131025155145	543	1

You don't eat alot and you have alot of shows including manitees. But it's sometimes alot of fun too! You eat in the pie cart. You also travel alot as well.</p>	2		20131024102315	693	2		20131024113856	545	2		20131025150914	539	2

You have to practice practice practice in order to get all of the streches righy. You have to be very flexible. Being flexible is good for doing backflips, backbends, and frountflips. If you want to be in the circus you have to have the right body type and be very determined. You have to put your heart into it and be certain that that thats what you want to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The seconed reason why its hard to be in the circus is traveling all of the time. Traveling is very hard because you have to travel to Australia, Japan, and all over North America. People travel on the road with 100 people who are like family. You never have any time</p> <p>for your family and pets because your so busy with your career.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The third reason why I think its hard to be in the circus is people think that being in the circus is all fun and games and goofing around, it's not. Performers work long days and spend alot of time away from home. In order to be in the circus, you ave to say good bye to your family and petsI would not want to be in the circus if I were you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021155318	537	2		20131022100351	690	2

They came to watch the animals not the clowns why did the clown have to be created you know that's studied because why else would kids hate clown.

Also I love to here oooooo's and aaaawww's in the crowd when I'm acting.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love it at the old circus because there are now people to meet everywhere, and I get to act in front of people who actually like seeing you do life treating tricks. Also I like seeing the others do their special tricks. Another reason is that I see the animals that you don't see every day. That's my story. :) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021153718	690	1		20131022084511	541	2		20131022162455	552	2

I'm Charlie I'm 18 years old and I work at the circus. The trapeze is my specialty. In fact the ring master says I'm his favorite trapeze artist. Even my best friend Jason the lion tamer says I'm good. I'm not so sure though.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Our circus travels all over Europe and Asia performing in places like Russia, France, China, England, and Taiwan but, my favorite place to visit is Italy that's where I'm from.We only take one or two trips a year and that day is today! When were in Italy I'll only have one day to be with my family so I'm going to make the most of it. Jason and his family are from Italy too. Jason's looks almost as exited as I am.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;That was the best trip to Italy ever. First I went to my parents house where they had set up a surprise welcome home party for me. Then we went to my favorite pizza place down the street, and I was stuffed by the time we left. After that we went next door to Jason's house. He was so happy to see us. His parents had also thrown him a surprise party too. He offered me cake but I told him I was full.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We hang around his place for a few hours. Next it was time to perform Jason and I had convinced the ring master to give our families front row seats right next to each other. Our families looked so happy while we were performing. Finally after the show it was time to hit the road again. Jason and I said our goodbyes as we got in train. We were sad to leave, but I bet next time will be even better.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021103519	690	2		20131021125248	545	2

Thank goodness there was a net there! I would have hurt myself really bad. Well if your wondereing what I'm talking about, well then im talking about acrobat! The easiest circus performance that you could fall and probaly break something.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I have learned from being in acrobatist for awhile, is that it takes a lot of muscles, concentration, and balance. Although it might seem so fun, its not. You could fall or if you look down it might be scary to you. So dont look down. It might seem scary at first&nbsp; but trust me it gets better.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple years ago my parents joined the circus, my sisters and I&nbsp; joined with them. At first we were juggleing. Now Im an acrobatist. Well sort of, Im really low to the ground but im still haigh enough to where i need a net under me. One of my sisters is training the horses, my other sister is on the tightrope. She needs really good balance to be on the tightrope, the good thing is that she has a net under her as well, shes gotten the hang of things but she still has fallen. My other sister, shes still trying to get the hang of things. I on the other hand, have never fell. I have slipped before, thats because i was supposed to.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get older i want to stay in the circus although im still in school, i dont mind the chores. I think whenever i do chores its an easier way to get more exersise. Ayway, when I am out of school im still going to be an acrobatist and I'm still going to do all my chores. Now you know about my circus life.</p>	1		20131024102315	693	2		20131024113856	545	1		20131025150914	539	1

I miss my family sometimes, so I call my mom every week. There is some fun to it however.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am part of a trampoline act in the circus. It is pretty fun! I have to do lot of flips then land on a horse which rides me off stage. It takes a lot of practice to get all the flips and leaps down. All while on a trampoline! If it is pulled of correctly, the act looks amazing and pro-like. Thats what I want it to look like.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some bad things about being in the circus. You work long hours (including the weekends) and rarely get a break. You also have poor schooling as well. Plus living in a trailer isn't the best kind of home. Also if you make friends, you will have to leave them. You can not comemit to any sports outside of the circus either.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; As you can see, there are good and bad things about being in the circus. So it's yur choice if you want to be in it.</p>	2		20131021154250	562	2		20131022100410	545	2		20131022165912	552	2

No food! No money!&quot; &quot; I am telling the police, fatso!&quot; WHIP!!! &quot;Owwwwwww!&quot; &quot;Ow, Ow, Ow!&quot; I said. I have just been whipped by the meanest, worst Chief Executive Officer ever. His name is Mr. Meani and we, me and my fellow workers, call him Fatso Meany. He owns the Circus of Awesomeness. We don't ever get a paycheck nor any food. Not even the children! He even put a fence around the circus so we don't run away.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well because of all this nonsense we are on strike. The children can't work anyways because they have no food. STOMP STOMP STOMP! Yes! the law enforces are here. They are looking around the circus. Many of the workers thank them for coming here. Then suddenly one of the law enforcers asks all the kids to come to him. He sees that they are starving. So, he tells Mr. Meani that he will have to bring the children home.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a performance tonight and we plan to perform very poorly. The trapeze artist is going to fall of the trapeze. The animal handlers are going to forget the animals in the trailer, and I, the tightrope walker, will cut the rope when I am supposed to walk on it. Minutes before the circus, we practiced how we would mess the show up. During the practice I got bruised badly, and so did the trapeze artist because we fell down, but we still had the heart to spoil the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the show, the CEO was really mad. He was as mad as a bear who had been disturbed from hibernation. He made us all stand in a line and blindfolded us. Then he whipped each and every one of us a couple times. Some of the older workers were moaning on the floor after that! We got so mad at this that we decided that we had to escape somehow. We brainstormed for hours but then with each idea we ended up realizing that we would be caught. Then I thought why don't we make an underground tunnel that leads us out. So, we started to make this tunnel.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we were done with it we decided to make batches of ten and give them names. My batch's name was Gemini. We were supposed to be the last batch to go. The first five batches were a success. When the sixth batch, Draco, went through the tunnel they were discovered by the CEO. The CEO was outrageous he had everyone whipped three times.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Draco went again, this time they escaped. Now that there were only 40 people left, the CEO was realizing that the we were up to something. For this reason, we decided the rest of the batches should go right away. When we were done the CEO was outrageous. He had lost all his workers. When the law enforcers came again they saw that there were no workers and that we had left notes describing how the CEO had treated us. So, Mr. Meani was arrested and put into jail. The remaining of us escaped to the Circus of Kavish and lived happily ever after.</p>	2		20131021224109	541	2		20131022100420	537	2

Other than ups and downs there are many different activities before and after a circus performence. We do many tricks like acrobatics, gymnastics, juggling, and many different tricks and fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; First, there is waking up then going to the pie cart, which is the place where all circus performers eat. After breakfast, they go to a school on the go in the trailers. The school has computers, tests, and report cards just like regular schools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they have quick breaks from work. They have fun practicing juggling, trampoline, acrobatics, and gymnastics. Then they have chores and practice for the circus performance. The chores include grooming, watering, and feeding the horses in the stable. They practice jumping on the trampoline and then onto a horse which requires great concentration. Many others are practicing juggling, acrobatics, and gymnastics</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then comes the show at night. Everyone eats before the show but not too much because they are performing later. Then they all go to their trailer and rest for the night. They do the same thing for two days then move on. That is a daily life of a circus performer.</p>	2		20131021133557	556	2		20131021222920	541	1		20131022114921	552	2

I got up and quickly went to change and take my shower because I knew this was another day at the circus. After a lunch of pancakes and bacon, I am at school at 9:00 am. I come prepared to school with all my pencils, erasers, notebooks, and textbooks. At 3:00 pm, school is finally over and I take a little break. After I finish my homework I then I practice the stunts I will perform during the circus show tonight. When we finish dinner of pasta and spaghetti and meatballs, we prepare at 6:30 pm and go to our three hour long circus show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk on two separate tightropes while I juggle five bowling pins while my dad is walking a alleged tiger while riding on a six feet tall unicycle. My mom is walking on a ball while juggling seven bowling pins. We received a wild standing ovation from the audience. After our turn is done, the next group goes on. The next group is even more wild and receives a great applause when a person does a double front flip and lands on his feet gently. Then the next group goes and then it is followed until the last group comes. After the three hour show is over, we walk back to the trailer sluggishly and tired.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We go to bed and hope to sleep quickly knowing that we have another show to perform the very next day.</p>	2		20131022164609	693	2		20131023104500	562	2		20131025092401	543	2

Well bub, trust me, this is going to be a story for the ages.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now it was a usual circus day with normal circus behavior. Steve the stuntman was perfecting his normal routine of being shot out of a cannon, Dion our head juggler is trying to get a grip on the chainsaws, Alfred was training with animals, and myself, Kamyar the Incredible, was on the tight rope as usual walking back and forth with some tricks through in there as well. Then suddenly, the unthinkable happened. the baddest man on the planet, Billy &quot;the toad&quot; Johnson. He was nicknamed the toad because he really liked swamps and had really bumpy skin. Anyway back to the story. Out of nowhere he broke into the our tent and mugged us. Yah, you read correctly, mugged us, this is no kid story! He stole nearly everything there including some of our extra clothes. We were wondering what we could do with just two days before our big performance. &quot; Hey guys, how about we make an A-Team,&quot; said Steve. &quot;That's an awesome idea Steve!&quot; &quot;I call being Mr.T!&quot; Okay Dion, you can be Mr.T.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We decided on our new costumes and we became the A-team. We then arrived at the police station to ask them what they know about Billy Johnson. We learned that he loves to disguise&nbsp;himself in a variety of costumes. So we made a plan of action for how we were going to capture &quot;the toad&quot; and we came up with this. Since the police had told us his location by one of their undercover operatives. So we decided that we where going to disguise our van like an ice cream truck, sneak up on him, and arrest him. We were set. Once we were in the same location and spotted &quot;the toad&quot; with his disguise it was go time. Dion and I rolled out of the van and hide close by Billy, while Steve and Alfred we driving the van with the cops in the same direction. Once Dion and I were right behind Mr. Johnson we jumped on him, tied him up, and ploped him onto the van. We then had found all of our things in time for the show. We never heard from Billy &quot;the toad&quot; Johnson ever again. Yes, I know this is about as cheesy as it gets but I will do it anyway. The end.</p>	2		20131021133217	562	2		20131021154341	556	2

Circus life isn't easy it's full of difficulties and I, Florence Scaboldi, should know. I live in a trailer with my mama and papa.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Every morning we wake up do our morning routine and then go to the pie car. We eat breakfast while the crews are setting up&nbsp; tents, lights, and music for tonight's show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Then, it's time for school in our one-room schoolhouse that travels with us.Our school is like any other. The other circus performers are from all over the world so some of my classmates are: French, Russian, and Italian like me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; After school it's time for a break I play with the clowns, animals, and my pet Baxter, he's small because we don't have any room in our trailer for a big dog.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Then I have to chores and practice my acrobatics. First, I take care of the horses we use in some of our acts. After that, it's time to practice for the show on the Spanish web and my dad practices carrying my mom, while he's hanging on a rope, with nothing but a kabob skewer!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Time for dinner. My family and I go to the pie car, but eat a little food because we have a show soon. We do ten shows a week: one each weekday, plus two on Saturday and two on Sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; At 10:30 P.M. the show is over and I'm exhausted. Walking back to our trailer, we pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers. In two days we'll set up for another show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Later, at midnight I'm thinking about the end of the tour across the country. It would be nice to go back home to Napol, Italy. I think if I will be a circus performer when I'm an adult like my mama and papa? Who knows? The circus is fun, but it's a hard and busy life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161158	935	2		20131022201317	537	2

There are circus performers from all over the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also have to prctice your acts like riding a unicycle while juggiling.You also do shows day and night.you dont get to meet other people.Another thing you get to do is travel to japan, Astralia, and all over North America.You get to see people get excited.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you work in the circus it's alot of people watching you and it's alot of hard work.You have to work hard to get into the circus like the right atetuid and you need a specific talent and you need to have rythem and you need to be flexibal.There are also afternoon shows.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before a show you have to get a costume on and if your a girl you might have to put on makeup like glitter, eyeshadow. When your a curcus performer you can travel and learn different launguages like French, Russin ,and Italian. when your done with your practice you can take a short break. When there's a show some acrobatics&nbsp; take out the net and when they fall and get hurt there's no net to cetch them uwhen they fall and hit the ground.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also when you work in the curcus a show usually ends at around 10:00 or 10:30 at night or at day. When your a clown you are going to were alot of makeup for your face and your going to were big shoes and white gloves and a weird wig.</p>	1		20131022161226	690	1		20131023130336	541	1

She has an 18 year old partner from Ireland named Alexzanderr Madonicase. They work together during shows and are best friends. But one day, Alysonni's leg and foot broke during one of the tricks in practice. She was taken to the nearest hospital with costume and all and had her leg checked out. When the results came back they showed that her foot was severely fractured and she had to have surgery on it. They thought that she may never be able to do another trick again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was recovering form her surgery for a whole nine months, Alexzanderr came to visit her every day until she went back to her home in Italy. While in Italy Alysonni thought about quitting her dreams of being an acrobat in Cirque Du Soleil. On her 18th birthday she got a call from Alexzanderr asking her to go to one of the shows in Italy. She quickly obliges and 3 days later her and her family go to the circus she once performed at.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the show, Alexzanderr dedicated his performance to her. After the show they met up and Alexzanderr was so happy to see her. They called each other every day since then. Alysonni had already got her cast off and was almost ready to perform again. She was still anxiously waiting to perform again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After the nine months passed, Alisonni was able to perform again. She was done waiting for the moment when she was finally able to be back and do another performance with Alexzanderr. After awhile, her and Alexzanderr both achieved their dream and made it to a Cirque Du Soleil show and became one of the best duo's in the whole circus industry.</p>	2		20131024113951	556	2		20131024144656	541	2		20131025155940	539	2

To me I wouldnt want to be in a circus cause theres always to much going on. But if i was i would love to be with the animals and teach them all kinds of tricks like jumping through a hula hoop and teaching them them to be nice to people and not bite them when the people are trying to pet them. I think it is really difficult to be in a circus with all kinds of things going on its like they are at a zoo.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It probably is fun but when it comes to doing things like swinging from swings but when it comes to me i would not want to do that. Or even walking in a ring of fire thats way to scary. I would like to watch one but not really be in it. It is fun watching people in a circus and watching them do magic trickes and even watch the animals. To me the animals are relly smart when it comes to being in a circus its pretty much the same as when people have a lot of stuff going on and have to remember the animals have the exact same thing going on but they cant talk so they just have to be smart and do it on there own.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing i wont look for if i was in a circus is the clowns because they are really creepy to me its like they just wear to much makeup and it looks really bad. I like the circus but i wont ever want to be in it at all only because its scary creepy and very dangerous if it wasnt scary creepy and dangerous i maybe would of joined it. But since there are clowns and its still dangerous im not going to ever do it. Maybe i would like to have a busy plan instead of just staying home and being bored.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing is that i would not want the animals by me i do not want to be bitten by them at all it pretty much is gonna hurt really bad. To me i really like the circus but i dont want to do anything related to being in the circus because if you dont have a net under the bottom of the swing you will probably fall and break something like your arm or your leg or your neck or maybe even your back.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022115945	690	1		20131022164500	693	1

I learned that the girl that works in a circus is named Bella, and her troup travels 20,000 miles in 7 months of a year.You have to be on time and can't mess up the act.You can pick to be a animal trainer, Acrobat,and even a CLOWN!!!!!!!! Do that pacific talent that you are told to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People leave their home for a long time.When they do they still have fun with the animals and the acts of performing.Their acts are very impotant to them because they work so hard to perfom that show .Most of the people that work at a circus like it, but you would always miss your family back at where ever you are from.You can also learn to do new tricks and make peole laugh when they are sad and you can cheer them up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should be very deturmand on what you are doing and hope you do it right. If you don't pay- atintion on what you are doing you could brake a leg or be very injurd.That's why you are tought so long ,so that you know what to do and how to do it.Once you know what to do you will never be scard and have no fear, because you know how to do it!Yes it does take along time before you get back home because you could be 1,000's and 1,000's of miles away but to work in a circus&nbsp; and do amazing things its all worth the work in the end.</p>	1		20131022165418	562	1		20131023092633	545	1		20131024222350	543	1

On night time we had to travel to another country to perform another show so when we got there we dressed up in our costume and acted funny so the kids would laugh and would enjoy us and tell them some of our stories. Being a Circus Clown is kind of hard because some of the kids are scared of us so we tried not to scare them but to make them laugh. Some of the people liked us as a clown and thought that we were nice and enjoyed our performance. It was really hard for us to be a clown because we have to work everyday and we sometimes miss our family because we nevered see them. A circus clown is kind of fun because we get to make kids smile and laugh so they can enjoy our show. Circus Clowns are like the people that makes people scared and happy so we can amke the childrens life haappy and exciting!</p>	1		20131021222142	537	1		20131022100513	562	1

It is fun to fly in the air but it is also scary to fall. Acrobats have to practice a lot so they don't fall. let me tell you a story about the time I wanted to join the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It began when I was 11 I wanted to be an acrobat. It was exciting to go and try out but then it was scary to do it. Another person saw me and told me to go for it so I did. I did it and the ring master said I did a great job. When every one was done he told me I made it in the circus. I was so happy I ran home.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the circus the next day and I started practicing with the other acrobat and it was fun. I fell a few times but after a wile I got the hang of it. I went home and told my mom all the things I learned. She said she saw me for a little bit but then she had to go. She said I did very good.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we did a show. I got nervose at first then my partner said to pretend like it was practice. I got up and went out there. when my act was over everyone cheered. I was happy.</p>	2		20131023130433	556	1		20131023154705	935	2		20131025131342	543	2

A circus travels around the world&nbsp; doing amazing acts. If you want to be in a circus you have to have&nbsp; talent a strong and flexible body and be determined. Although you might think to be a circus preformer does not </i>include learning it actualy does . Traveling around the world includes geography. Have you ever thought what job you would like to have if you were a circus preformer. In my opinion i would be&nbsp; a acrobatic.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In the circus you might see exotic animals like elephants, tigers, bears, camels, seals,lions, and horses. You may</b> also see amazing acts like lion taming, trapeeze, acrobatics, clowns, fire eating, and sword eating.The circus is a big group a people who travel around the worl amazing other people. You might also see people from all over the world. they might speak different languages too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever thought if it would be fun to live with a circus. in my opinion it would actualy be fun but hard. It would be fun because you meet people from all around the world and learn how to speak different languages. It would be hard because you would have a lot of chores and you would have to wake up early.There is many fun expieriences in a circus . You would also do the same routine every day.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a circus the main colors are red and white well in my opinion there the main colors because they represent the clowns. Clowns are the main act in a circus. Most people go to the circus just to see the clowns. Clowns are funny and amazing.Clowns are probably the main act.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a circus there is a total of 12 jobs. There's&nbsp; trapeez, acrobatics, lion taming, training animals, food vendor, juggling, ticket vendor,ring master,usher, stage hand, clown, merchandise vendor. These are the main jobs in a circus. The jobs are not ordered .

Being a acrobat is a hard and long routine. You will need to learn all the tricks. Other things at a circus is easier. If you fall when doing you acroat tricks it heurts if theres no net or if it riped.?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to do somthing else you also need to practice that. Juggiling is hard, that takes concertation and skill. You need to have even objects. If you don't have even stuff you will mess up and get embaressed. If you use sharp things you need to be extra careful.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other things are a bit easier. Taming animals is easier because the animals are half trained at the zoo and half at the circus. Only certain animals are at the circus. Monkeys, tigers, and dogs are the main animals at the circus. There are so many I named a few.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also another job is mortor cycling. Where you are in a big cage and do tricks and loops. It is the coolest thing you could ever imagine and see. It is the most popular thing to do.but it takes major concentration.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161158	935	2		20131022201317	537	2		20131025084205	539	2

You need to understand that at 7:00 A.M. you wake up get dressed and go to the pie car. 9:00 A.M. School time. Our one room school house travels with us. 3:00 P.M.Schools over,time for a quick break.3:30 P.M. Chores and practice.6:30 P.M. Dinnertime. 10:30 P.M. The show is over :00 A.M. In bed thinking about the end of our touring season. One of the upsides is that you get to travel all around the world. You get to work in Australia, Japan and all over North America. The circus has given me the opportunity to go to so many different places and meet so many different people. I travel on the road with 100 people who are like a circus family to me. When you're young it's the time to do it. It's the time to travel, the time to grow and experience your life. It's great to see the faces of the audience just jump alive when I make eye contact with them during a performance. Despite what many people think the life of a circus performer isn't all high flying fun its just great to see the fans.</p>	1		20131023161608	690		N	20131023214900	545	2		20131025142734	539	1

She was so bored, then on t.v she saw the circus was looking for new performers and she suddenly had an idea that just popped into her head, she could join the.................. CIRCUS!!! But how would she tell her mom, should she run away, no that would scare her mom half to death, maybe she could slip a note into her bedroom, or maybe she should tell her mom face to face, no because she would then get really MAD. So she decided to slip a note into her mom's bedroom. Then she was off to the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She finally reached the circus in Idaho. She made it into the circus because the boss was a clown, so he'd hire anybody. She did her first performance after two weeks of training but she couldn't hold on so she decided to do a trick where she tied 100 balloons to her waist in just the nick of time before she hit the ground she started floating up , everyone was amazed! Most people were so astounded that they passed out.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She missed her mom and she asked the clown to see if she could call her and this is what the clown said, &quot;I can't let you do that,</p> <p>because my boss will hit me with a bat&quot;. So she just turned away and she decided it was time to go home. She missed her mom and she missed her puppy, Noodles. So she left a not near the front door near the boss's office. Then she was off to her real home.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took her three days and three nights before she reached her front door. She rung the doorbell and her mother was in tears and swooped her up in her arms and did not want to let go. As soon as she let her down Noodles came running and licked her face clean. They were so happy after that. And Fluffleluffagus never ran away again.</p>	1		20131022165418	562	1		20131023092633	545	1

She kicked her feet up and did a perfect backwards arial but missed the rope!! she fell to the ground and landed on the edge of the saftey net and bounced off. She was ruhed to the hospital in a circus ambulance and was told her cuncussion would disable her for the rest of her life.

My name is Casandra the Great. I am a magican that works here in the circus. Life here is always fun, but it is also tough.Our whole family works in the circus. We each have a different act. My brother is a clown, my sisters are acrobats, and my mom and dad are animal trainers. It's a lot of fun especially when you make someone happy. People think that being in a circus is a lot of fun, and it is, but it also requires hard work. If you want to know more about the circus life, keep reading!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing I do is wake up in the morning and go to the pie cart to eat breakfast. If none of my family is up I go to wake them up to give me breakfast. Then I get ready to go to school. I know what your thinking, &quot;how does this girl go to school if she keeps moving&quot;, the truth is we have a trailer that looks a lot like a classroom and all the kids go there so we could learn. For our recess, We go to the horses and ride them. We also go and see what the clowns are doing like my brother. After our recess, we go back to the trailer and start learning again until lunch. For lunch, we all go to eat corndogs, hotdogs, and popcorn. This is just in the moring! Of course we get out of the classroom in the afternoon, but this is what we do in the <b>morning</b>! Are you starting to see that being in a circus is hard work! If you don't keep reading.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we get out of the classroom, I go into my trailer and just relax. I might also go and play with my brother and sisters. I would also play with my dog Coco. He is a small dog. Then I start getting ready for the show. We all start practicing for the show. Of course I always practice on my brother. I always do tricks on them to see how my tricks end up. I always need to concentrate on my tricks. If I lose my concentration I will mess up real bad! I always need to think on that day's show. Then when we are finish practicing, we go to the piecart and eat. We are not allowed to eat a lot though. This is in the afternoon! Next, is the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show is finally here! This is always the time when everybody is nervous except me. I am always the opening act. It's always a great honor when you get the opening act. It is also awesome that you get to amaze them first. We always need to worry about who goes on first and second and so on. There is especially some preformers that get sick because they are really nervous. Now you know that it is a hard job.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know! It isn't a easy job. To be a circus preformer you will need to be confident and determined. You would also have to be used to staying up late. If you have all these traits then join! you would love it!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022162015	539	2		20131023115930	556	2

The circus is fun and entertaining because circus clowns are trying to make people laugh. Acrobats fly around and do backflips and frontflips to the audience. Circus jugglers maybe juggle rings, chainsaws, and other fun and dangerous things. The tightrope walker tries to balance on two feet and tries to balance on one foot. That is how life in a circus is really entertaining.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circus clowns are funny and make people laugh. They do juggling, funny jokes, other tricks, and fun things. Clowns can make little kids cry when they show up. They can do a lot of daring tricks. They can also do magic to kids and grown ups.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Acrobats make people amazed when they do amazing stunts. They can also do backflips amd frontflips. They can also ride a motorcycle and balance it with the rope. Life in the circus is really hard for people who are in the circus show. The acrobats maybe practine in gymnastics and in gymnasiums. They can also swing each other around the circus. When they swing around, they come back to there normal spots.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A circus tightrope walker amazes people when they balance on one rope. They can use two long sticks and put it on there feet and still they can still balance on one rope. They can use a unicycle and can ride across the rope and doesn't fall. The experience of a tightrope walker is to be determined and be really good at balancing. I think tightrope walkers have the hardest job in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Circus animals do a lot of animal tricks in front of people. The trainer of the animals must work hard in this job. The animals can do tricks like balancing on a ball, being disappeared in the cage, and jumping on rock to rock. Animals like horses can jump and can stand up for a certain time. It takes a lot of work to be a trainer of all the animals in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It takes a lot of work to be part of the circus. Being an animal trainer is really hard, but you still have to strike hard in it. My favorite circus part is the acrobats. I like it because they do awsome stunts. Philippa said that when you're young It's time to do it. It takes a lot of work to be in a circus job because you don't have time to rest and you are busy everyday. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023130535	537	2		20131024113817	539	2

They were getting ready for tonight's big show. It was hard to focus. I knew I needed to practice, but my mind kept telling me not to. I was tight-rope walking over fire.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Okay.&quot; I was talking to myself. When did I ever talk to myself? I was nervous. Very nervous. I was aware there is going to be a net between me and the fire, but I don't trust nets. I have fell through one twice already. I was balancing two feet above the ground when Autumn walked in. Autumn was a horse trainer, and a very good one. She could persude a horse to jump through fire!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oww!&quot; I fell on the ground. She startled me. &quot;Oh! Sorry.&quot; Autumn helped me up. &quot;I need to talk to you about your act.&quot; I was comfortly seated in a chair. &quot;My act? Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;I know your'e nervous, everyone is. But the audience doesn't want a net to help you.&quot; Autumn was trying to sound as calm as possible, but it was hard not to. I just stared ahead. Out to the circus tent. I could hear beyond to red and orange stripes, into the big tent with bleachers and trainers.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hello?&quot; Autumn wasn't very patient. &quot;Oh! Sorry. I-I am afraid. Even without the net that never really works, I'm really nervous.&quot; Now I was pacing around the caravan. I didn't know what to do. I know, I needed to be confident, but how could I? I needed balance, and when you're scared that doesn't help. But I agreed to walk on a string, anyways.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Balance!&quot; Autumn yelled at me from nearly thirty feet below. &quot;That doesn't help.&quot; I whispered. At least there wasn't any fire yet. There would be at dress rehersal. &quot;What?!&quot; Autumn couldn't hear me. &quot;I said,&quot; I finished the rope. &quot;I said, yelling doesn't help.&quot; Now I was climbing down the ladder. &quot;Okay. Dress rehersal in an hour.&quot; Autumn walked out of the wide, open tent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dress rehersal was fine. I just did not look down. If I did, I would fall into flames.I survived-dress rehersal! Now for the the real show. I stood up by the tight-rope the whole time before my act, posing and pretending to be scared at dangerous stunts. It was time. I closed my eyes. &quot;Don't look down. Don't look.&quot; I forced myself. Alright. There was a twist.</p>	2		20131022162601	693	2		20131023085443	541	2

Reason 1, Is that you need someone flexiable and able to do many things. I could clean cages, tight rope walk, Acrobatics, or, teach horses tricks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Reason 2, Is because im great with animals One time I got a dog it was in 2007 and She's stil healthy. Everyday I would feed the animals before anything else. Plus i will clean up the pets mess.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Reason 3, I love doing chores if you would look at my room or the living room and even the dishes they are squeaky clean because I clean them as soon as they start to get dirty. So if the elephants have a accedent il will be there to clean it up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Reason 4, For my act I could juggle or even be a clown. I once juggled 8 bean bags at one time! I could even maybe juggle 8 glass bottles with some practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That is why you should chose me for the circus contest.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022120002	693	1		20131022152632	562	1		20131023211050	543	1

You eat from a pie cart, which is a place where food is stored. You eat whatever is made.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a school there too. It's there so you can have an education. If you thought going to the circus would get you out of school, it wont. You learn new things everytime.

In fact,last spring,we went camping in a forest in North America. It was the best time of our lives. It was also way better than shoveling the poop off the training equipment. Although it was the only camping trip of our lives,it was still the best camping trip of our lives.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Our day started out like any other ordinary day; wake up,eat,and go to school. After practicing our routines,we dressed for the show. After the show,instead of going to our trailers&nbsp; and putting on our pajamas,the ringmaster announced that we would be going camping with the rest of the circus. I was excited of course, but my parents looked as if they had won the lottery. They were as happy as clams to take a rest from work. Naturally,there was a catch to skipping work...we had to bring food for everyone! Not even that could take away the excitment of going camping for the first time in our lives. So the next day,after the show, we packed our bags and went to the forest behind the circus tents. Since we had to bring food,my mom brought s'mores,potato salad,fried chicken,and chips &amp; dip. Man,did we eat a lot! Within the first hour of our trip,we had already finished half of the chicken. While eating,we were telling scary stories. When it came the time for me to tell my terrifying tale,my parents didn't want me to get nightmares,so they decided it was time for me to begin going to sleep. The kids had to sleep in the tents with our names written down on them. As soon as I found the tent labled,&quot;Carlita,&quot; I was amazed by its level of comfort. Knowing that I would have to get up early,I fell sound asleep. In the morning,when I woke up,the adults were already packing up the leftover food and tents. We all walked back to the circus and put away our things. It was the best camping trip ever!</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that camping trip,I never stopped asking if we could go camping again. Even though the ringmaster said,&quot;no&quot; constantly,I just knew that we had to go camping again. There is nothing better than going camping.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113936	562	2		20131024133512	693	2

When I started working in a circus thats the first job i wanted to worke on. Ofcouse they said yes because it wasn't a hard work for a beginer. I also had to feed it, care for it, and play with the leopard. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the shows I did, I was wiped out.

Sally May had no friends that is why she wanted to be in a circus . She read alot about circuses and she saw them on tv. Sally Mays favorite part about a circus was the tightrope walkers she thought that was really cool because you had to have alot of practice to be able to do that kind of stuff. She always wondered if you had to have your shoes on to be able to do that. Sally liked everything about the cicus and she is going to tell you a little bit about almost everything they do in the circus. the first thing she wants to tell you about is the circus clowns . They always have silly faces painted on them sometimes&nbsp; they are&nbsp; sad faces sometimes they are happy faces . The next thing she wants to tell you about is the circus arcobats that is one of the most dangerous ones. If you ever go to a circus and you see&nbsp; this she advices you not to do this at home it is some times when you are hanging in mid air and maybe about to fall you are holding something in your mouth dangling below when some one else has that same thing in there mouth dangling above you. The next thing she wants to talk to you about is a circus juggler. A circus juggler can almost juggle everything or anthing from bounct balls to fire torches to sharp blade knives . But not all people can do that so she would advice not&nbsp; to do that either. Here comes Sally's favorite part the tightrope walker. You defintely have to have alot of practice on a balancing beam. Sally said that she cant even balance on her bed so she knows that she cannot balance on tightrope. Next she has to tell you about the circus horses.&nbsp; they have to have so much practice. The circus people can make them jump they can leap over things&nbsp; and they can make them do any tricks. That is what Sally had to say about the horses. and everyhing about the circus........Oooops did I forget to tell you how old she is.... she is 5......BYE</p>	1		20131023150120	556	1		20131023161651	693	2		20131025134328	495	1

I am going to tell you about how to be a performers. Also the life of a circus kid. Witch is both cool and hard. I am alos going to let you know about the cool animals as well.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First off, let me tell you about the performers. For a performing example in source two it states that not just anyone can go and join the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. I know I could not do that because I afrade of hights. People who are part of a circus need to have a lot of specific talent. I know I could not be in a circus but I would love to go see one. What is amazing to me is that some kids start as young as five years old. I am eleven and still would not do that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, I am going to tell you about the life of a circus kid. Inside source one it states that, anyone who thinks circus life is nonstop play is crazy. In Bellas case her family travels 20,000 miles in seven months each year, visiting 150 cities. Bella works from sunup to sundown. There is know way I could do the things that these kids do every day of there life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, I am going to tell you about the animals. The circus uses all kinds of diffrent animals. Some are horses, elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. The chimps are my fovorite. What is your favorite? Another thing that I find cool about the animals is the horseback tricks. I have also seen the elephants play with big balls. Witch is really cool I think. some of the people even let the elephants walk over them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To wrap it up, the life of a circus kid is not all fun and games. It is a lot of staying up late and working. Some parts might be cool but other parts are hard for most kids. Like it said in source on it is not nonestop plying. It is hard work. I would love to go see one of these families circuuses.</p>	1		20131022120150	556	1		20131022132317	539	1		20131024083828	543	1

But first if you want to be in a circus you have to have a specific talent , the right body type, and have&nbsp; to be very determined.

The circus director (the boss)</b> <b>asked me if i wanted to go on tour and go all a</b>round the <b>around the world with them and guess what i said &quot;YES&quot; screaming. So I went to tell my mom&nbsp; when I&nbsp; got home from&nbsp; work I saw my mom cooking dinner&nbsp; I told her&nbsp; &quot;Mom my boss wants me to go on tour with them&quot; and she just stood there looking at me. So that's when I told her if I could </b><b>go on tour and she said &quot; well i don't know baby its like you leaving the city and going all around the world without your family&quot; and I said &quot; I know but its a great opportunity to go and discover&quot;. So I went to my room and started thinking about what I'm going to do then i said to myself&nbsp; &quot; I think you shouldn't go on tour because your going to be very homesick&quot;. So I went to my bosses office and told that &quot;I don't want to go on tour with Because its a big step in my life to leave my family&quot; so he said &quot;its alright if you don't want to go you don't have to&quot; and i told him i want o quit my job and he said what why and so i told him why and he said alright pack your stuff and go.

We feed the horses every night so who ever feed them last must of forgot to close the corral gate.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I walk over to see the chores list I hear another scream but this time it was Jay Jay the clown. I walked over to see what was going on and there was one of the 5 horse laying on the ground. I took its pluse and it was still breathing so we called the circuses vet. She said the horse is ok it justs has a broken leg and is banned from preforming for 2 months.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were about to keep on folowing the horseshoe tracks when we heared a thumping noise. It was the other four horse but they were running to the train tracks and the train was coming. We all got in to the nearest car which was a small clown car. Luckly I was wit the two smalls clowns so it was easy getting in. We flew over to the train tracks right when the train came 3 of the horses did not run but Lucky the daredevil horse did.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shows about to start and we still haven't found lucky so, we decide we will call it a night and look for him tomorrow. We only had 2 horses that were usable so we did are best but the audience wasn't pleased. We ended the circus early and I went to put the horses away and there was lucky standing&nbsp; in the corral.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't belive my eyes. The one place we did not look there he was. After I put the horses back a ran into the pie cart and told everyone luckys back.After that the whole group decided to put on the show tomorrowfor all the people that came tonight fio free.All the audience loved it and the horses too.</p>	2		20131022141028	77	2		20131022141528	543	2

Paige was always watching her Dad in the circus and wanted to try it for herself. But her Dad thought it was too dangerous and if something went wrong Paige would get really hurt. But Paige did not want to give up just because of that. So that night when Paige was in bed she thought &quot;what if my Dad got a day of from juggiling and the circus and watched the show&quot;. Paige could ask the top director of the acrobats if she could tryout to be on the team. After that hard thinking Paige decided to go to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the early morning Paige went to the acrobats trailer and knocked on the door. &quot;Come on in the door is unlocked&quot;,it was the main coach Barbra Loantin. So Paige walked in and Barbra asked &quot;Hi sweetie do you need something&quot;, Paige said &quot;I wanted to know if I could tryout for the acrobat team&quot;. Barbra's face was shocked but she said &quot;That's fine with me if it is fine with your Dad&quot;. Then Paige gave a guilty smile and said &quot;It's ok, ish&quot;. So Barbra said &quot;meet me in the morning hunny be ready to give it a try&quot;.&quot;Ok bye Barbra. So that night she knew what she was going to wear her Mom's old acrobat suit with an American flag across it and big stripes hanging down from it. So Paige went to sleep early to get a freash new start in the morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That morning Paige woke up really early and went down to the traning center and Barbra was waiting there for her. So first Barbra got Paige into a harness to first see what she can do. Paige was spinning and flipping everywhere. From that moment on Babra knew where Paige got those flips and turns,from her Mom. So Barbra got Paige out of the harness and told her she could perform the next day. So when Paige was on her way home she stopped at Barbra's house one last time and asked for Barbra to give Chris her Dad a day off so she did. That night Paige thought what if my Dad was right, what if I get hurt will it all be over? Paige did not know, so she went to sleep so those thought's did not get to her.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So today was the day Paige was going to perform in front of not just a thousand people but her Dad. So the clowns just went and now it is time for the acrobats so Paige went out on stage and did flips her Dad was so impressed. But now she is going to do the triple dragon man. Only the best of the best could do that. But she tried it and succedded and the crowd went wild. Now she is not just known as Paige Thomas the juggelers daughter she is PAIGE The Great Acrobatic!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022204031	562	2		20131023084636	539	1		20131024160251	552	1

You can't just join the circus, you need talent to the join it. Also you need to concentrate on what you are doing because if you don't you can't join. You also need to give it all you got to join. If you don't do what is said you won't be likely to join the circus. Now let me tell you how it is like but in a story.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Hi my name is Bob I am a clown if you what to know how it is like in a circus I will tell you. It is a lot of work, there is a lot of concentrating to work here. But this story will tell you what to do. long time ago a boy wanted to join a circus well he needed skill to join well he did it but that is when he found out how hard it is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that boy finaly went to join the circus and when he got there he became a tamer a day he worked. Then when it was night he went on stage. He whipped the tigger then when it was over he went to packup to go some where else as for every one else.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He then met the other people they all welcomed him they told him his chores for tommorow. Well he finished the chores and acting, some people were also finished so they played a game of cards. Well years went by and traveling around the world. Still lots of cities left to go.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Lots of people he met but he loved hs family to he will retire soon to but he will keep&nbsp; working well there was a knew act he never preformed taming there lions in stead of one tiger. well he neededto concetrate so this time he did not look around sometmes but looked carfully well he did it. then night came and he did well aso his parents came to see and cheered the loudest.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Well he told his parents he is coming back they were happy but only until 6 months well days past new acts came. But he still finished the whole thing. now it was his last day so he did a really good act. So he was to whip 5 loins and one tiger. he finished his act then went home and learned there is a lot of responsiblty and concentrating.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; Well that is all you have to learn but still keep doing what I said and you can join the circus.

A tipical day for a&nbsp; girl that's in the circus starts out at 7:00 A.M. She gets up, gets dressed and goes to a pie car to have breakfast. At 9:00 A.M. it's time for her to go to school. 3:00 P.M. When's schools out there's a quick break before you have to go practice for the show tonight.</p> <p>6:30 P.M. Dinnertime, they normaly don't eat a lot because of the show that night. 10:30 P.M. The show is over and your super tired.</p> <p>12:00 A.M. Laying in bed thinking how the show went.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When your in the circus you travel to many different places. It's a fun experience in your life, but also a diffucult one to. Your always away from your family until the season is over. Plus your working with people all over the world. Like from France, Russa, Itally, and much more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just geting the chance to join the circus is hard. You have to practice, practice, and practice some more just to become a acrobat or trapeze. You need to have the right body type and be very determined. Like I said it takes years of practice just to get the move right. If you join the circus you to be certain that's what you want to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last other thing about the circus is the jobs. If you join the circus you could be a Circus clown, Circus acrobats, Circus juggler, Circus tightrope walker, or train Circus horses.&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023220152	537	1		20131024102107	539	2		20131025144758	543	2

If you have a really good talent, like juggling or acrobatics, you can join the circus and show the crowd what you're made of. Of course, fame doesn't come without hard work, so you must practice and concentrate on your act.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once you have your act done to perfection, it is now your time to shine! You will probably have several shows each week and you can impress the whole audience with your skills. Now, after a perfomance you will probably be dead tired, but you cannot sleep in the next morning. You must prepare and prctice your next act.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, if you are a kid travelling with your parents, life is just as hard and fun. You must wake up at 7 AM and go to school. After school you can play with the clowns or do whatever you wish. Then it is chore time. You must make sure the animals and equipment are in top shape, so you have to inspect and feed the equipment and horses. Finally you have to perform in a show they might have that night. The day starts all over again the next morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, if you like thrills, hard work, and performing, the circus is for you. You can perform, play with the clowns, and help out the perfomers. I think the circus would be great, however it requires a demanding amount of work and practice.</p>	2		20131023131652	693	2		20131023150911	690	2

As the ballerenas came on stage and did the best thing I've ever seen at the circus when they were done the tight rope walker was as high as he could be he even had a special surprise for the crowd of pepole. He pulled out a tricycle and he began riding it on&nbsp; the rope. He started to wiggle a little bit but then he got it back on track and did awsome.The middle of the show was even better than the ballarenas. They were dancing in the air it was cool. The elaphant was the funniest the clown was always scaring it when he smiled ''because clowns have all that makup on so it spooked the elaphant.Then the best part about he show was that every one was scared about the man jumping the shark. when he did everyone hallard in fear and closed thier eyseis.My favaret part was when they had the horses ''the man trained his horses to stand up for about 5 minutes every one claped for the man then he had a little speech. He said all his life he wanted to have a horse when he was 15 he got a job working for the circus. So his big plan was to entertain a horse then he ended up with two horses to work with.So then he was realy suprised that he could work with a horse or two. The end was cool because the the magishan cut the clown in half and let his legs out and they started walking around the box'' then the legs got back in his box then the magishan put the clown back together.It was a creepy thing to do so everyone was amazed that he could pull of a trick like that.The clown affically told every one that it was just fake and it was not real.Then the next thing that happend was the box sword trick. They had a crate and ten swords.They put all ten swords in the crate for about ten minutes and took them out. And the women got out of the box and was alright they annonced not to try a trick like that at home beause these are proffesinals that monuver thist for weeks at a time. Then all of a sudden tickets were falling out of the sky then after all the tickets were out of the box. They told every one it was elegal if u had two tickets so if your partner dident have one you need to give them one so i got one and the number was so close to my number 557324- 557329. I was as mad as could be the winner was down in second row seats he jumped up filled with joy. The ticket he won was to go to next years circus and bring two frends. It was also next year was to get a full free chiken box wihile watching enter taioners preform.

And sometimes the face paint starts to itch and it gets really annoying.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>second, there is so much work you have to go through its not worth it to entertain complete strangers and you barely get paid. if you pay to much and dont get any money back you will find your self in debt or jail!just think all those tents you have to set up all the stuff you have to bring with you that would be a hassel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>next, i always see clowns swallowing ballons then like cough them back up. i would not want that to be me. what would you do if you swallowed the ballon then chocked on it. it sure would be hard to cough that up. i am not going to risk my life just to draw attention to my self.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>last, i hate the type of clothing they wear it feels so wierd. i cant amagine having those type of clothes on for so long. i dont&nbsp; know how they wear them but i might just wear regular clothes under the circus clothes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>i am not a fan of circusis but you can be in one if you want to. if you do i wish you luck.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	0		20131024113935	562	0		20131024143059	539	0		20131025152648	543	0

There is alot of cool stunts and awesome things about the circus. my favorite thing about it is the stunts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think bella in the real story liks the circus and doesn't sometimes. Shes been practicing and that is how you get better.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly the circus is hard and fun at the same time. you have to practice everyday and still go to school.

You will learn normal subjects and be taught like normal kids. You then prepare for your show that night. You might practice tightrope, maybe flipping, jumping, flying, etc. Being part of the circus takes dignity, agility, balance, coordination, concentration, and integrity. Preparing for the circus may take a lot of time. As you get ready for the show you may feel scared. You must overcome that fear and get ready.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your part of the show that night may be different then some others. Your act may involve teamwork. Just do your best. Soon the show is over and you go back to your trailer. It has been a long day, but you have another big one tomorrow!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Your Traveling</b></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You usually travel to many cities to preform, and that may take several months to go everywhere. Your geography lessons might just be where your heading. Many circus groups travel to different countries, sometimes even different continents! If you get homesick easily, the circus probably isn't for you!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The pros and cons</b></p> <p>There are good things and bad things about being in a circus. The good thing, is you get to do many performances and visit all over the world. But you don't see your family very often. You are usually away for weeks, months, even years at a time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Many people do the circus. They do all kinds of performances, travel the world, and do what they love. But being a performer can take years and a lot of practice. But if you can do it, you can be a great circus performer!</p>	2		20131023213454	545	2		20131024090056	562	2

We were in Washington D.C, ready to preform for the president.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seals were honking, clowns were busy pushing custard pie down their trousers, horses were training, and acrobats were flying.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Alana, your turn,&quot; the kid in front of me called.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I bravely started to climb up the ladder, my palms already starting to sweat.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Bradley, the kid who was in my performance, swung off, his feet curled tightly around the swing. Ha came closer, so I jumped off and stretched out my hands.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice went flawlessly and as a reward, everyone was treated to a restaurant. The food was delicious, and I was confident we would do great.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it was finally time.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! TO START OFF OUR PERFORMANCE, WE PRESENT TO YOU, THE HORSES AND THE ACROBATS!&quot; announced the ring master.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were neighs, and suddenly, a bright flash of light. I confidently strode to the middle of the ring, which beheld a the two ladders and the swings. Bradley mirrored my move.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally got to the ladder, I gave myself a quick &quot;<b>Don't screw up&quot; </b>lecture. Then I started to climb, and the act began.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bradley swung off, and I reached down. He flipped me over, where I got a hold of my own swing. Then I swung myself on the bar two times, and at the flip of the last one, Bradley jumped off and I grabbed a hold of him. Next, Bradley flipped off and I followed him.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But something went wrong, horribly wrong. Either Bradley didn't flip fast enough to catch me, or I followed too soon, but I started falling, to the ground below. We were pros, and we didn't have a net. I wanted to scream, but I didn't want to humiliate the circus or anyone! So I just shut my mouth up, and pretended it it was part of the act.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&quot;Pancake Alana in three... two...&quot; </b>I silently thought to myself.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, out of nowhere, I heard a shrill whinny. There was a thump, and I landed on a horse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desert Storm! He had caught me and was now trotting at the edge of the ring. Every one was clapping, wolf whistling, cheering, and whooping.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Desert Storm stopped in front of a man in a black suit. THE PRESIDENT!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&quot;Oh jeez. Please let the president like it!&quot; </i>I prayed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president smiled and stood up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I LOVE IT!&quot; he declared, in a deep booming voice. The cheers sharpened acutely in volume, and the noise made the ground shake.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sighed. All right with the world. And hopefully, no one busts their ear drums.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023130535	537	2		20131023200047	545	2

My dad is a clown so he is always telling me jokes and my mom is an acrobat like me. I love being in the circus but it is also a lot of hard work. My favorite part is that we get to go to so many places.I have one pet dog named buddy but i also get to work with many other animals such as horses,elephants, and tigers. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to join the circus remember that it is a lot of hard work. Today i am going to tell you about a circus that went terribly. It all started when the elephants were dancing. A little boy in the audience had some peanuts and he threw some onto the stage. All of the elephants saw and ran toward the peanut. After that the boy kept throwing more peanuts and one of the clowns riding a unicycle ran over one and slipped. it was a disaster but everyone thought it was part of the act so we kept on going. Finally after the boy ran out of peanuts all the chaos stopped and the show went on.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later that evening when it was time for my mom and I and all the other acrobats to go on i was very nervous. It was one of my first shows because i was a lot younger. i was so nervous i almost puked but i still did the show. but when i was in the air i puked. i was so embarrassed. luckily there was no one under me and it just landed on the stage. while we were doing our act a clown came out and cleaned up the puke.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that night i was scared that i wouldn't be able to be in the circus anymore but i still got to be in the circus. all of the adults said that they were scared their first show and they didn't blame me. and that is the end of my disaster circus story.</p>	2		20131022120002	693	2		20131022152632	562	2

Everything is busy, and there are a lot of customers watching. since I have a first-hand account, let me tell you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, there are the customers. They never seem pleased enough. We always have to do something new to exite them. Never the old &quot;Clown on a unicycle throwing pies&quot; routine. Always asking for something else.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, there are the acrobats. They're friendly, but everytime they talk to me, I have to bring out my phone to get Google Translate. I know they have all their time filled up with practicing, but they could at least learn English! Especially when they're swinging around on the trapeeze and we tell them to stop because it's closing time, they just look at us strangely.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this last paragraph is about food. I can't really explain the pie car. Somedays the food is good and it reminds me of old homecooked meals, but that just maked me homesick. Other days... Blech! It tastes like a pile of burnt McDonalds hamburger grease! Those days, well, those days I just eat an energy bar.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was my first hand account of circus life. I hoped you like it, and notice how fun, and not fun circus life can be. I have to go clean the horses for our next act. Bye!</p>	1		20131024113912	537	1		20131024144108	562	2		20131025155748	543	1

Also did you know that a circus life isn't all easy, and fun and games. Well sometimes it is but not always. What you have to do to get in a circus is you have to have certain things like what your skills are, what you body type is, you should never give up, and you have to be very determined to reach your goals. I will list some up's and some down's about being in a circus!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circus life isn't always fun. Because you have to learn the new life styles of a circus actor. For example, When you start off your day it is pretty normal and you still have to go to school. But the school is a one-room school house. When school is done you get a while to play but you still have to get ready for the show that you have to do tonight. As a circus preformer you have to do 10 shows a week and that can be really tiring even if you are really good at preforming in a circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your in a circus you have to travel a long ways from place to place so you are always on the road going to a new place. Also you have to give everything up to be a circus preformer because you never stay in one place for about more than 1 week. Finally, you have to work long hard days practicing over and over again what you learned or what you are learning for the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also a circus life can be fun?. For example, if you are a circus preformer you can show your skills to the audiance and also before the manitee/show you can play with the things that you use during the show! Also you meet new people that are from all around the world! so you can learn new languages, and cultures.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also you can travel all around the world to some places in Aisa, Like Japan and China. Some places in Eupope like the U.K. Also you can travel to a lot of places in North America that you havent been to. Another fun thing is you can learn new skills, tricks but you have to be very determined.&nbsp; Also you can become really good friends with the new people that you meet that preform with you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you know you have to work long, hard days practicing your skills, you can travel all around the world to some places you have probably never been to.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113924	541	2		20131024140601	935	2

The circus is a big place! to be in! and the place who people buy tic is the circus. The circus is a fun place to be in and they can show some tricks to tell how to do it and you can get better if you can do it. And you can come back and see because you can show to your friend but never tell them how to do if you know the tricks and you can be happy in your self. The circus is&nbsp; wonderful to go and watch it because you can be in one if they let you and you can be happy too but it okay to not be in too. I learned that the circus people has some tricks want to show you and you will happy to see it and you will come back to see it again and you will also be proud of your self. I learned that clown are scary but there not only something. if they are going to show a trick to you will be happy to see it you can go to other different circus and you can grow up to be on the circus then you can teach them how to do a trick and you can teach more people to do even more ticks.the ropes are made with string and something. you can be one if you grow up to be one .

We travel to a bunch of different places around the world. Most people think that circus people think that it is a fun job, and you only have to dress up into costumes and dance around. Well it's not! It is a job to entertain people and make people laugh and say &quot;ooh&quot; it is suppose to look dangerous. I would really like to join gymnastics but we move all the time, my parents think that I basically am in gymnastics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tonight we are going to perform in front of a live crowd in Religh, North Carolina. My mom is going to tight rope and do circus acrobats. My dad is going to do stuff with a tiger and an elephant, and also juggle rings. I asked my parents and&nbsp; since they know that I wants to be in gymnastics I am going to perform gymnastics tricks!And 3, 2, 1 the circus began. All of a sudden my mom goes, then my dad goes 30 minutes later, and last but not least I go on flipping in to the stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight was very tiring night. Now let me call my grandparents, oh ya I remember I forgot there are no phones to use. That's what happens when you are a circus family you usually can't call any family members.&nbsp; Another downside is that you can't really go to your home and visit your family, what I learned you always stay on the rode. I am going to go to my bedroom and finally go and do something I want to do, so I am going to read.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning! Now I have to go to the eating cart and get some eggs and bacon. I eat while my parents start packing up to go to another circus show. I am done eating I go into the car I have to quickly get dressed for the next show my mom has to sit in the back and get some of my makeup on. Since I only got to sleep for 3 hours last night, I sleep on the car ride down to Miami, Florida. We are here my mom and dad quickly rush out of the car and start training the animals and setting up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we are done now we get to go see our family. Travel to Neenah, Wisconsin. I haven't seen my family for a year now, I am so excited to see them! Well that is what happens when you are in a circus family there are ups and downs. I hope you learned a lot in my several paragraphs of how a circus family works.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely.

I had to get used to all the steps I had to do in the morning. It was challenging to remember all the steps. After a few weeks I got the hang of all the steps there were like 7+ things I had to remember. When i forgot to do something I didn't get yelled at. That was good.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I want to tell you that there were down sides to be in the circus. First, I didn't see my family for a long time I couldn't even communicate with them when I was on the road. It made me fell really bad that I couldn't talk to my family. I thought that they didn't like me when I came to visit them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when your in the circus there are also up sides. The up sides are that you can travel around the world and get paid to travel and do acts. You can do your favorite thing out in the circus. you can mess up it wont really matter but people will notice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, comes my favorite part. I worked with the Magical Karlotta she only does magic but awesome magic. She flies up to the top of the tent, and spawns a rabbit with her eyes. I work with lots of people but my favorite is our own fine tightrope walker Kampiter. If you see him you think he will ask for a rope and do his thing. When we were practicing at the tent he tooke dental floose and did his thing walking across that. I think thats pretty amazing. Well I hope you will try to join the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>	2		20131022203938	545	1		20131023130534	537	2		20131025101353	543	2

Also there's tight ropers, acrobats, tiger and lion trainers, and people who ride elephants. I won't forget my birthday on September 19, 2009 when I had my first show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;It was 7:00 in the morning and I heard somebody saying wake up wake up. I instantly sprung out of bed and I screamed, &quot;It's my birthday, September 19.&quot; I got dressed and went down to the pie car and had pancakes and bacon. I was taking with oldest tight roper in the circus and his name was Lyle Stuben. He was the oldest but was only 35 years old.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>School was done and raced to begin to practice. I was going to feed the tigers with the tiger trainer. it was there hours till the show . the show was about to begin and my stomach started hurting.

I am going to tell you about the resources, how many hours it takes in one circus day, and how early you would get up. I am also telling you my opinion on the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The resources you would use are stuff like animas such elephants, horses, and sometimes other mean animals like jaguars. In the story they said a lady would walk jaguars. You also need to practice a lot with the animals. In the story they would practice doing somersaults off a horse and leap off a trampoline onto a horse.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; A typical day for someone that works for the circus such as a kid. The kid would get up at 7:00a.m. get ready then go to school at 9:00a.m.. At 3:00p.m. school would be over then at 3:30p.m.. you would practice. At 6:30p.m. you would have dinner then preform. At 10:30p.m. the show would be over then at 12:00a.m. you would be in bed going to sleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; You would wake up at 7:00 and go to bed around 12:00, which in my opinion I wouldn't like. I dont think I would like the circus because I don't like getting up early. I also think I would be bad at preforming in a circus because I would be scared to ride on animals and do all of the jumping and twisting in the air. Thats my opinion on the circus.</p>	1		20131022100420	537	2		20131022112122	539	1		20131024083702	552	1

Then we get ready for tonight's show tonight. Then the crew sets up the music, tents, and the lights and music.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to school at 9:00 A.M. Like any school we have computers, tests, and report cards. Many of mt classmates speak a lot of different languages, like French, Italian, and Russian. So its hard to communicate with other people when I don't know how to speak that language. At 3:00 school ends. Then i get to play with their unicycles and juggling ball.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:30 P.M. I do chores and practice. I water, groom, and feed the horses I use in our horseback acts. I'm working on leaping from a trampoline onto the horses backs. And i also play with my tiny dog named Noodle; our trailer is way too small for a huge pet. Our neighbor walks baby leopards on a leash, and our trainers are working on elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. Me I do the specialty for the circus. I'm the one who does the walking on the rope one, and I do stunts with the animals.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the after show we have a grand slam. We bring lions, elephants, and all kinds of animals that we train. Also we have a fire stunt seen only one in a lifetime! Plus we will even have animals doing stunts in a pool and other things. Ill be doing my finally called the swifter. I get up on stage and grab a partner from a crowd and amaze them with my magic. I will pull a a deck of cards out of my hands and levitate it to whoever I picked. Finally the last part of the show is the flaming hoop. Only I can do this I will run and try to jump the a hoop flaming with fire. When I did it the crowd was going crazy and I was then the best mannish ever.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023130337	541	1		20131023135357	693	1		20131025104819	543	1

First off all not every body can be in the circus because you needthe right kind of body and skills for about half the jobs thier. But if you do get in then thiers a good and a bad side about being in the circus. Keep reading to find out what I'm talking about.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The good news about the circus is that you can be alot of stuff in the circus. You don't need to have a great body to be in the circus. If you want to be a animal trainer orclown or something else you can join the circus&nbsp; if you just have the skills. But the best part is you get to travel around the world all the time. You can go to places like Moscow, New York, Canada you name it. The circus is really great and exciting but there is a downside. </b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>But the circus and traveling around the world means your far away from home. Plus you don't get to see your family very often which stinks. And your always wondering about the show and nothing else. But worst of all it's preparing for the show and that must take like forever. So the circus isin't all fun and games like you think it is right. But mostly it is pretty cool to me and mostly fun and games like you thought it was.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>So, that's a sum up of what the circus is like and that's that. But heres the quistin, do you want to run of to the circus or stay home. Acctully I don't even think it works that way and you have to be excepted&nbsp; or something and they'll&nbsp; put you in the circus if you just show up.

He had been making every body happy once he even started a circus player because it was his dream to be one. Then he got very happy because everyone got his autograph and to be in pictures with him. So the next day later John went to the circus to do the big show,then once he came there was no one there,only the circus people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he saw another tent beside the circus tent they work at. Then John went inside to talk about that the owner is ruining John's career to his job.So after that tough day he put a sign that says free food and drinks. Then he thought a new idea. It was a person who walks on a tight rope then if he falls he will land on the biggest pillow ever.Then some people came after couple of hours. But they left quickly like couple of min ago.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So the person that owns the tent beside him, he made a decision of him fighting over population of attention for people to come in their tent to get more famous. He made the police stop him from fighting over population from tent to tent. So he made it equal population by adding more things to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also what the police did is to hire a new worker instead of John. So John was in jail for doing all the stuff he did to Issac the owner next to the tent what he used to work at. The next day Issac came then he felt sorry for John,so Issac let him go from jail. Then they became buddies and they worked together at Issac's place to work at.</p>	1		20131023164302	562	1		20131024100238	537	1		20131025130418	552	1

The performers have do practace hard so they can acomplish their trikes. To whant to peform at a circus you must be able to do comething. For example the clowns are funny, theirs strong men, circus acrobats,&nbsp; circus jugglers, horses that can do some trike, and a lot more.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If youget a chance to go see the circus then the chance are that you will find a clown. Some eople think that clowns are scary and freeky. Other people think tht clowns are funny. What i thinf is that clowns can be both things. If they put on to many make up then theymight looke freeky, but if they put on the rifgt amount then they might be funny to other people.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the prson that runs the place then they have to worry, becuse if some thing happene during the performance then th can be a problem. For example while the acrobats are doing their poformance and one of them fall what will happen. Enan if they had a net, what would happen if thy didnt. That prson could of got serasly hurt or some thing like that. Though are the worries the manager has to worry about.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animal that the ciruse have might be wild animals, but they are reay tamed.A circuse will never brink a animal to the circuse that is not tamed.

The reason why you need to practice is because when the show is about to begin and the curtians open and you stand there doing nothing, you should either run as fast as you can to get off the stage. You can also practice your part until your part comes so that you can start performing your part. The second thing that you should have is flexability, strongness, and no fatness because with the fatness people are going to think that you are not strong. The last thing that you should have is a very good memorization so that you won't forget your part and you standing there on the stage having nothing to say nor nothing to do on stage or what ever your standing on.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having force is a really ceriouse thing because if you don't have force or srength and you carry a person and you drop the person you are going to be the responible person for the person's accident and you are going to have to pay for it too.The other reason why strength is important is because if you try to do something that has a lot of consintration and a lot of force and you mess up you are going to ruin it. The siquences of these things are very important thing that aren't toys for fun these are very ceriouse things that you need to know. The other reason why strength is needful is because it helps people do amazing these and carry some heavy things. The last reason why strength is needful is because it helps people carry things some other people haven't tried to carry.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two pictures that I think describe about what a circus performer would do are the ones that have a man carrying a woman by the rope which is called a Circus acrobat and the one that has the man walking on a rope which is called a Circus tightrope walker.</p>	1		20131021094949	562	2		20131021104650	545	1		20131021131326	543	1

Here are some paragraphs why I think this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One reason why I think this is people who live in circus don't have time to get a social life and never get to do what they always wanted.People who live in circuses never saw there home or got to stay in one place for the rest of there life.Circus performers never get to see the life of which they came from.They never get to play or do stuff.They are always tired after they performed and they don't get to sleep for very long.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My second reason why is that they almost don't get to do what they what to do.Here are some details why I think this.I think this because they have to work none stop and then go to sleep and do it all over again the next day. I think this because no one gets to stay anywhere for very long.They never get to go to the place they always wanted to go.They never get to have any alone time and always have to be practicing for the big show they have to do every single night.there is my reason why I think this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There were my last reasons why I thought that .

She tried to ignore all of that so that she can achieve her concentration. Still, she had to get herself to concentrate. She knew that it was very complicated, but she tried her best anyways. She also knew that her family is supporting her even though they weren't there. Emily thought about the time when her family were encouraging and comforting her about her being afraid. One at a time, she rode her unicycle onto a shaky wire. Trying her best, she avoided looking down the ground where the dirty sand was. The dirty sand sort of looked like they were waiting for her to fall down. She tried to do it as cautious as she can, trying not to make a mistake. Slowly and carefully, she rode her unicycle on top of the wire. &quot;Almost there,&quot; Emily whispered to herself. Finally, she made it to the end of the wire. When she made it, the people clapped their hands happily.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all of those concentration, she drank cool refreshing water to calm her fast - breathing down. Her circus mates congratulated her for doing such a complicated work in the circus. She thanked them all, but she still missed her family. Next, her circus teammates and she went to another country ( which is in U.S.A.) Her family were also there so it was very easy for them to enter the circus of where she was performing. When they were in the different circus, she saw her family waving to her and shouting her name. It was Emily's turn to juggle tiny golf balls while riding on a giant ball this time.&quot; There is no possibility that I'm going to be harmed here because the giant ball isn't that high,&quot; she thought to herself. So again, she did her part and finished her goal of balancing. After that, she said goodbye to her family again hugged each other.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when they returned to their normal circus, Emily had to do acrobats. She was trained how to be flexible and how to balance more. When she was in front of the stage, many people were cheering her name and clapped their hands. So, she hanged her hands on 2 rings that were tied to a rope( while the rope was hanged on the ceiling).She spun around for about 12 seconds and stopped. While she was up there, she did the splits in the air and also made complicated tricks onto the ropes. Again, the people cheered and clapped their hands. Now that Emily was having fun in the circus, she realized that when she does fun things in the circus, she stops worrying about her family. &quot; Being in a circus is very fun after all...&quot; she whispered at her mind.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113829	935	1		20131024134204	537	2		20131025151326	495	2

To you it may just seem like a bunch of dumb clowns running aroud but it's much more. I joined the circus when I was 12 after running away from home. I don't really remember why ran away but it must have been a pretty good reason because I don't get mad that often. The circus is buisy, very buisy. My job in the circus in being an acrobatic. Here is my story of how I got to the cirus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wandering alone looking for some place to call home after running away. The sun was going down and all I could see what seemed to be a never ending road that looked like it would go on for ever, and ever,and ever. I had been going for three days and already wishing that I wou have packed more water and food. All of the sudden I hear a bunch of noise and turn around to see head lights of a car! I sick my thumb out and they stop when they do I see red writting on the side of the truck. It said circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hey you, what do you need&quot;said the man driving. What to say, I probably shouldn't have said this but I was hungrey and needed shelter.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I ran away from home and I'm lost.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Same here kid,wana join the circus? Little pay but you'll get free food and shelter.&quot;He held out his hand and I shook it. I hoped inthe back and we drove to our destenation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started setting up and then went to sleep. The next day they taught me everything I now know about the circus, and here I am with the best job in the world, working in the circus.</p>	1		20131023150911	690	1		20131023155903	552	1

And it is hard to change places all the time like say you have to go to Mulingire, Ireland for a day and then go to England&nbsp; for 1 more day then go to a different place but you want to stay in 1 place in sted of going other places all the time.Well tightrope walkers are really happy about their jobs they get to stand on the ropes all day and get to perform live every night bet it gives them a rush because there are a lot of people and if i have a singing job. i would have a rush to also because to see how many people care about me and love my music but enough about me now about the tightrope walkers all i know about them is that they have to walk on ropes.Okay now about the jugglers well they juggle all kinds of stuff they can juggle rings, shoes, hats, and books!&nbsp; Okay now on to the horses. Well as you all know were talking about horses to be clear it is called circus horses&nbsp; because people need them in the circus so if they need to do a back flip on a horse they have one to do a back flip on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The End</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131024141536	935	1		20131024144920	545	1		20131024161547	539	1

Her mother laughs slightly. &quot;I understand that Kayla.&quot; she says pulling into the parking lot of the stadium. Kayla quickly got out the car and ran to her mothers side opening the door for her then pulling her out of the black vehicle. Kayla practically skips to the opening at the side then walks in quickly. She was chosen to see what happened back stage at a circus! She looked around and saw people ran around franticlly in a hurd ready to start the circus. Everyone was feeled with nerves and excitement. Tonight would be there first circus in the town for the first time! All the circus preformers were running into each other until they heard someone yell. &quot;Watch Out!&quot; then a loud boom then a high pitched cry coming from across the room everyone ran to the cry. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; A tall man in a top hat asked kneeling down next to her just as soon as Kayla got there. The girl whimpered quietly. Kayla looked at ther girls swollen, bruised leg she winced in pain. &quot;I was just walking and then one of the unicycles fell on my leg.&quot; She cries out. &quot;Well you can't do the show now Natalie.&quot; A young women with oversized glasses said to the girl sitting on the floor. &quot;I <b>can </b>do it.&quot; The young girl hissed trying to stand up and then almost falling and almost hit the ground then the women with the oversized glasses held her up. &quot;You can not Natalie! You can't face anymore injuries!&quot; The girl who Kayla now figured out was Natalie sat with her hands to her face sobbing quite loudly. &quot;What act did she preform?&quot; Kayla said building up the courage to even speak. &quot;She worked on the trapeze.&quot; The man with the top hat said finally acknowledging her existence. &quot;Oh...&quot; Kayla responded quietly. And then the women looked at Kayla. &quot;Do you want to be our trapeze artist for the night?&quot; she asked. Kayla looked at the lady stunned then at her mother who's face was equally as stunned.Then Kayla's eyes widened in excitement once again. &quot;I would <b>love </b>to!&quot; She exclaimed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Kayla knew all about trapeze artist it was her favorite part of the show. She's always imagined twirling through the air being free and able to fly. It was absoulutly lovely to watch.Trapeze artists would start off swinging on a bar and then would twist through the air and there partner would catch them and they'd continue to do that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>About Thity minutes later Kayla stood on a stool with a handle above her ready to be grabbed and Kayla's hands clasped at her side were ready to grab it. She jumped up and grasped the bars tightly and swinged her legs back and forth and then let go twisting and twirling through the air. She was afraid of heights and didn't want to look but she <b>wanted</b> to keep on looking at the ground as she twirled elevation above it and then she did a front turn as the other trapeze artist grabbed her hands and continued swinging. Kayla smiled widely.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>She would always remember this moment.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021135709	545	2		20131021155033	935	1		20131022144917	552	2

In order to get into the circus you must have skill, flexability, and the ability to never give up. My job is to do acrobatics like flips and tightrope walking and stuff like that. When doing acrobatics you have to be precise and accurate when flipping, turning, and balancing. If you make one mistake you will have to face danger, say you slip up on a flip, you might end up across the room laying on the floor because you put your hand in the wrong spot or you flipped sideways rather than straight. Being in the circus is very, very dangerous and you have to take risks. I remember one time when i was beginning acrobatics aroung the age or 7, I slipped up on a flip and landed on my head, I was lucky I was still okay. Thats what i meant by never giving up, I almost got killed doin what I loved but i just got back up and kept trying harder and harder everyday. It takes practice every bit of free time you have, you should be practicing.</p>	1		20131022161326	556	1		20131023132128	935	2		20131025094130	539	1

If I was in a circus I would love to do flips and tricks all the time. I would like to be in a circus because I like to make people laugh. Being in a circus would be really fun. All in all, now you know why it would be fun to be in a circus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would be an acrobat because I think it would be fun to fly in the air and show off a little bit. being a clown would be a little wierd for me because I don't like clowns. If I went to a circus I think it would be cool. I think I would watch the acrobats mostly. All in all, thats why I wan to be an acrobat. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, there is a clown. Clowns are funny. I like clowns but not the scary ones. All in all, now you know about my opinion about clowns. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I think I like soccer better than circus.The Circus I don't think is in anymore. The circus is a coolthing to watch. There being funny and thats what makes it entertaining. All in all, now you know about the circus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161304	541	2		20131023094911	545	2

I'm brave! I can do it! She considered the offer and nodded.She was going to join a circus!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well then, let's get you started by letting you meet the lions.&quot; said the leader.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lions were so cute!I don't think I saw anything cuter. I just joined the circus a few minutes ago, and so far it's not as bad as I thought it was.Right now the crew is showing me the lions so I can know who they are.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here we have Lisa, she's very shy and she'll grow attached to her trainer quickly.This one here is Roger.He can be very stubborn so watch your back.The last one is Rose. we call her that because she is very sweet and lovable.I think Rose will go perfect with you child.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My name is Mallorie by the way.&quot; I should have told them my name when I first got here.It sounds so weird calling me child.It sounds like&nbsp; I'm there kid or something.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mallorie come here and see which lion will chose you.Here's what you do:First put your hand out to each lion,then the lion will sniff it, and if the lion didn't want you it backs away.Now if the lion does chose you it presses it's face against your side.Now chose your lion.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked up to Lisa and put my hand out as I was told.The lion came up and sniffed my hand thoughtfully.It tipped its head to one side then backed away.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger was a different story.The crew had to hold him down for me.I was cautious as I put my hand out, but nothing fatal happened. Roger sniffed my hand quietly then growled.Wow, he really needs some training he's a beast!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose was nice and quiet.She rose to her paws and sniffed my hand.She walked up closer and pressed her face to my side as the leader said one of them would.I stroked her fur and backed away.The leader was right!She was perfect for me!</p>	2		20131022164609	693	2		20131023104500	562	2

I thought they were playing a prank on me like they always do, so I went inside their cabin and said &quot;guys this isn't funny it's gotten really old&quot;, and when they saw me they said we didn't pull a prank today. I stared at them like they were maniacs and said &quot;then why is there an eyeball on the ground outside?&quot; They didn't know, so when I went back outside and picked up the eyeball, right as something caught my eye I looked up and they were gone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I walked to the pie car I&nbsp; was thinking so hard that I guess I wasn't looking at where I was going and I ran into Mack, the groomer, and I saw him holding his eye and asked him what had happened to it, but he just ran off. That was very unusual for Mack to do, he was usually very talkative and spunky. That's when it hit me mabye Mack somehow lost his eye. Instead of goig to the pie car I ran to our own cabin, grabbed my journal, and locked myself in the room.&nbsp; I noted everything that had happened today about finding the eye, seeing mack holding his eye, and the clowns, usually very honest, saying it wasn't a prank.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When It was time for the show, my dad was frantically looking in his pockets, and saying where did I put it?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022100338	935	1		20131022111947	556	1

You do many performances and travel around the world to do them. depending on when the show ends, you either do or don't get enough sleep.So, circus life can be tough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	0		20131023095007	562	2		20131023115027	543	0		20131025103145	552	0

I get out of bed slowly. Then I go over to my dresser inside our camper and take out some clothes for the day. After I get done getting dressed I meet up with rest of the performers at the pie car for breakfeast. As we eat breakfeast we watch the crews set up the tents, lights and, music for tonights performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 9:00 A.M. we take our breakfeast and dump it into the trash and head to the one room schoolhouse that travels along with us on the road. Like any school we have computers, tests and, report cards. Many of my classmates speak different languages such as French, Russian or, Italian like my family. When we travel through the country its like our geography lessons come alive. Today we have a writting assignment we have to write a 5 page story on the american revolution. As the bell for school rings I finish my story turn it in and head down to the break area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:00P.M. We are at the break area. The clowns let me play with their unicycles and juggling balls. I can almost ride the unicycle without falling off but it is too hard. Allthough the unicycle is too hard i can juggle pretty well. I thank the clowns for them lending me their things and go play with my dog Noodle. He is so small Our trailer is too small for a big dog.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 is chores and practice. I go do my first chore wich is to feed, groom and, water the horses. We use these horses in our horseback acts. I finish up my chores and head down to the practice field. As my father practices somersalting off a running horse I practice jumping from a trampoline on to a horses back. To do this stunt takes balance and a lot of concentration. I see other kids practicing juggling and acrobatics. Our neighbor walks baby leapords on a leash. Trainers are also working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:30 is Dinnertime. My family and I go to the pie car to eat, wile we are there we dont eat much because we have our big performance. We do 10 shows each week: one show for each weekday plus a matinee on Wednesday, two on saturday, and two on Sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At 8:00 we are getting ready for the show that starts at 8:30.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>8:30 it is time for the show my father and I are the opening act. My dad takes the lead on his horse. I follow ten paces behind running. He sommersalts off the horse and the horse keeps running. I sprint for the trampoline and jumpoff of it doing a flip in midair landing on the horse. I let one hand off the saddle and wave to the crowd as they cheer for us.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>10:30 The show is over and i am so tired. As my family walks back to our trailer we passd the circus office, conssession stands, stables, and trailers. Two days from now we will be set up in another town.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022210720	537	1		20131023133152	562	2		20131024115504	552	1

There are lots of other people here. I'm not the only kid here, either.</p> <p>There are lots of kids walking to a ride or going into a building. But I'll bet you hardly any of the kids here are in a show. But I am. I'm in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now before you ask, no, I did not run away from home and join the circus. It has been in my family for a long time.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I do an act in the show. What I do is several things. I work with the horses. I can make then jump through a hoop. I can also&nbsp;make them jump over obstacles, too.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I also do a bit of acrobatics. I have been working on doing a flip in the air while on the bars.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I love it when the advanced acrobatics do this trick. What they do is first, they need a partner. &nbsp;Then, they both go out and link arms. One person falls onto the floor then jumps on a trampoline onto a horse. It is AMAZING!!!!!!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are lots of other acts in the show. There are ones with lions and tigers and bears. Also there are ones with monkeys. My sister actually walks Suzie (her favorite monkey) on a leash to the trainer during the show. (Since she is small, we only have her do little thinks.)</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The show is starting!!! Shhhhhh!!!!!</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, children of all ages, welcome to the Krazey Circus!!!&quot; Then the lights go out and the first act starts.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's an act I'm in. Suddenly, a hoop is set on fire!!!!! Then the lights come on and you can see a chestnut brown horse jump through the flaming hoop. You can see a golden hoop and a white and black-speckled horse jump through that hoop with a rider with a pink suit on. Then we do the course. We both jump over lots of obstacles. Then our act is over, and another one starts.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In this one, bears with bow ties dance. Then it is over.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In this one, monkeys and lions look like they are having a conversation.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So the show goes on.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That day through all of the acts I'm not really sure how the rest of our day went. But before I knew it, we were on our way to a county fair, ready to start another day of circus fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113829	935	2		20131024142504	562	2

Why do you always complain about your job?asked the ringmaster.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Oh, sir, I didn't see you here!Ur?What did you say again?I am so sorry that I did not hear you.&quot;replied Niki.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Niki, I do know that this is hard work, but you have got to understand that your parents are counting on you. I think you should take a break and think about what I just said to you.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp; Niki nodded and went to her tent. She sat down on her bed and began thinking about her parents.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Gosh, I think the ringmaster is right, Ishould know how hard it is for my parents to see me go I should work hard and think for my parents&quot;said Niki to herself.</p> <p>&nbsp; The next day, Niki was grooming her horse, she needed water so she went to her tent to grab her water bottle,when she came back the ring master was standing there admiring her horse.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Sir, are you alright?I do not hope my horse has a problem!</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Oh Niki, I didn't know that this was your horse, I think you have groomed it well!&quot;answered the ringmaster.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Why, thank you! I thought about the words you said to me yesterday, I think you are absolutely right. I agree to what you said to me.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Very well, I am sure that your parents are going to be very proud of you!&quot;said the ringmaster.</p> <p>&nbsp; Niki blushed at the compliment. The ringmaster walked away and Niki went back to grooming her horse. The day went by quickly. The next day was Wednesdy the show is coming.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Oh, I know that I have done this many times, but I have a friend that lives here, and she is going to see me working in a circus and laugh at me!&quot; said Niki freaking out.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;It is all right Niki. This means that you are a string girl! A circus is hard work and you are a sucess!&quot;said the ringmaster.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;I owe you too much. You have helped me come this far. THANK YOU!&quot;said Niki.</p> <p>&nbsp; &quot;Now go on out and show every one how speacial you are!&quot; said the ringmaster.</p> <p>&nbsp; Niki stepped out onto the ring and performed beautifully. Everyone clapped at her amazing performance.</p> <p>&nbsp; Niki smiled and bowed to everyone.</p> <p>&nbsp;&quot;This is the happiest day of my life!&quot;</p>	2		20131024112649	693	2		20131024125429	556	2

I started swinging and swinging until I caught a bar and flipped into the net. after I bowed to the crowd I &nbsp;walked off the stage.I walked right into the circus owner Mr.Dickenson I said I was sorry and started to walk off when he called me back I got scared. I had heard rumors that he was the meanest person in the circus. He asked me if I wanted tocome over to his trailer and have some cookies I said sure but really dident want to go.I walked with him to his trailer and stood in the doorway he gestured me to sit down and have some cookies that were already laid out. I sat down and thought &quot;maybe he isent so bad after all&quot; and it turns out I was right he was really nice. he talked about how he bought the circus because he used to love the circus when he was a kid. And I told him How I ran away from home to join the circus. When we had finished I walked to my trailer and went to bed.</p>	1		20131022161226	690	1		20131023130432	556	1		20131025094130	539	1

If you</p> <p>didn't know, I am a tight rope walker and the manager of the Circular Circus. You must be thinking that life in a circus is very hard because of all the practice and acts that are done. Well that kind of is true, but working in the circus is also very fun. Here are a reason few reasons why.</p> <p>First, we get to meet a lot of new people. There is a diversity of</p> <p>people: French, Russian, and Italian. They can be beneficial. Suppose there is a French kid, and he is learning about Venice, Italy. He may not understand something about Venice. He can learn about the place from an Italian kid. The school geography lessons come alive because we go almost everywhere.</p> <p>Next, we get to do a lot of stunts. Some of them are using</p> <p>unicycles, juggling balls, somersaulting off a running horse, leaping from a trampoline onto the horse's back, acrobatics, walking baby leopards on a leash, and trainers working with elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. I am a tight rope walker; it takes a lot of balance and concentration. This is not a stunt, but I am also the manager of Circular Circus. This helps because I get to schedule the performances according to the performers convenience.</p> <p>Now you should be thinking, that life in the circus is not boring</p> <p>at all, but instead very exciting.</p>	2		20131024113830	935	2		20131024135502	693	2		20131025155748	543	2

You can see different cities like: Ontario, Boston, and Philadelphia. You can also see new states like New York, Massachusetts, Canada, California, Main, Florida,&nbsp; Idaho, and Maryland.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;You can also see cool people doing cool things like: Acrobats, Jugglers, Tightrope Walking, Ringmasters, and Clowns. You can meet new kinds of people who like: the circus, art, juggling, anyone with the same interest as you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Also you can see what your learning in school in person like: if you learn about the Statue Of Liberty, you pass new your in your circus trailer and you can actually see it, like it said in the story, &quot;It makes geography come alive.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;There is a lot of animals you can see to like: Lions, horses, elephants, chimpanzee's, giraffes, some really talented dogs and cats, and sometimes (a) bear(s). A lot of animals are part of the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A circus life is a busy life and you need to do a lot in order to make through some dangerous acts. If your an Acrobat, if you miss the target you have to grab you fall either onto a net or on the hard ground. If your a Tightrope Walker and you lose your balance then you also fall to a net or the hard ground. If your a Lion tamer and your trying to tame a lion but happen to get to close, you c an be eaten alive. If your a stilts walker and a stilt breaks you can break your leg. Also if your a juggler and you miss and hit your head.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Life at the circus is fun, hard, dangerous, and filled with learning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023161651	693	1		20131024113829	935	2		20131025141932	543	2

Being a part of the circus might be tough but it is so much fun. When I was a little girl, my mother and I used to always pretend we&nbsp; were in the circus . But, my father never approved of the circus . He said the circus was childish and silly, you see he was a lawyer and didn't like childish things. One day I told him that I wanted to be in the circus, he got so mad he lighted the fire place went upstairs and got all my circus things and there them in the fire place and said ''Rose you will never go to&nbsp; the circus. That same day&nbsp; my parents got divoreced. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But enough about me let's talk about the circus. The circus owner is my best friend's dad and my best friend Grace is the other trainer.The circus life is nonstop work&nbsp; but , the funnest part is when we perform . I sometimes feel that they only come for the horses.Other than the horses my favorite part is the clowns.They make me laugh so much even thinking about them makes me laugh.<b> </b>Being part of the circus makes life a little more fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally I must tell you about behind the circus curtains.People are all sweating even they have done this a bunch of times. Sometimes the coustumes are so bright they almost blind me.The trainer coustumes are very simple skirts with a with a simple shirt that macthes my skirt. That is my life in the circus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131021133217	562	2		20131021155328	545	1		20131022111032	552	1

They don't just want any people at the circus they want smart people there.Being a circus performer is very dangerous.That is why I think we need to respect the circus performers . And just because you didn't&nbsp; like the performance I &nbsp; think you should still clap because it is showing respect for them because they worked hard. They can be fun also .

They have to go to school&nbsp; and study like us .

The clowns are funny because they make jokes.The jugglers juggle balls and little hula hoops.The tightrope walker walks on a tight rope with out falling.The horses go around the stage and when they finish you can take pictures with the little horse.The acrobats swing on metal bars</p> <p>and grab on to each other but you have to grab on tightly or you will fall on the net.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best part is the end because you can take pictures with the acrobats when it is over.The people from the circus do hard work for us to laugh and smile.I think becoming a circus&nbsp; person is not that bad&nbsp; because you make people laugh and children to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The End</p>	2		20131021110819	693	1		20131021130203	690	2		20131022084659	552	2

Some people think clowns are scary but they aren't they are very nice. Tightrope people face a lot of danger. Like falling of the rope and land on the cold hard ground. Riders face of falling off .May also be trampled to death.</p> <p>The jugglers don't have any thing to fear. If you juggle something heavy you could really hurt you self or get a black eye.</p> <p>These&nbsp; people do a lot where they get hurt very easily. Hallow they make it look very easy. But it is not.</p> <p>I would like to try it some time.&nbsp; I could walk a leopard.Ride a elephant. Be a lion tamer. Also be a acrobat.</p> <p>All that stuff may be fun but very dangerous.Also it would be fun to be up in the air.It would be fun to ride a elephant. I just don't under stand how the people cannot be hurt. They do all this stuff and not get hurt it weird.</p> <p>Nothing is impossible they say so I take there word for it. It would be nice to see a clown once in a while.&nbsp; See people shot out of a canon. Also little clown cars. Also see how they are so cute.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Seeing tightrope walkers walk it would be scary and good at the same time. You would never want that person to fall and die. taming a lion. That would be scary and hair raising.Standing on a horse and jumping off would be spectacular to see.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You may even see water shoot out of the flowers&nbsp; on the clowns shirt and get wet. That would be funny. Seeing them fight.Calling each other names. Also a lion tamer who would make every body nervous. That is what happens at the circus.</p>	1		20131024112824	539	1		20131024131729	690	1

After the show my dad told me we made $200,000 and that i did a great job and so did James.It was 10:00 and i was tired so i went to my trailer and got in my night clothes and turned out the lights and went to bed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <br><b>THE END</b>	1		20131022120150	556	0		20131022161303	541	2		20131024095142	552	1

I, Andrea Smith, will tell you how I made my dream turn into reality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived with my older brother, mom, and dad at the time. I liked my older brother, but everyone always told me how I should follow in his footsteps. I wanted to live my own life, not be my brother's shadow. My brother was skilled at many things, but I knew no matter how hard I tried, I would never be like him.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on one fine day in August, when I was ten years old, I decided I would run away. My parents actually allowed me to do it, and I believe it was because they thought I would come back. I do visit them sometimes now. I remember packing a large suitcase with food, water, clothes, and all other neccessities. I also remember trying to to stuff my oversized tent into my bulging suitcase. I had forgotten to think of one small detail: If I ever did run away, where would I go?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no relatives in America. So, I stayed at my best friend's house for a week. I didn't tell her that I had run away. I just told her I had come over for an extra-long sleepover. Then, I left and roamed the streets, looking for a job. I saw a poster advertising a circus. It said: <b>Come one, come all! Come to our circus-extraordinaire</b>!<b> Cloony Clown's Club auditioning for talented clowns! </b>I remembered my long-forgotten dream of joining the circus. I quickly noted down the address and, dragging my heavy suitcase behind me, ran through the thick crowd, shoving people this way and that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached the circus tent and rushed inside. The words I had failed to notice on the flyer earlier were etched on a large poster on the wall in front of me, plain as day: <b>For talented performers, ages 11 and up!</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't believe it! I had come this close to achieving my goal and now it had slipped from my fingers! But that's when I remembered something: My birthday was on June 12, and today was June 11! I ran outside and sat down next to the large red and white polka-dotted tent. At exactly 11:59 PM, I rushed back inside and said &quot;I'm auditioning for Cloony Clown's Club. I've heard that you need a trapeze artist.&quot; as fast as I could. &quot;Well lucky you, there's only one more spot left.&quot;,the lady at the counter replied. As she said this, I watched the clock above her head. It read 11: 59 59 sec. &quot;How many years old are you?&quot;,the lady asked. And then putting on a big, broad smile, all the while watching the clock, I replied,&quot;Eleven, ma'am, I'm eleven!&quot; &quot;Well then, welcome aboard!&quot; I couldn't have been happier to hear better words!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is the story of how I became the best trapeze artist in Cloony Clown's Club!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024112650	693	2		20131024144656	541	2

Today was the biggest day of my life, to day there was going to be a circus show. I would show everyone what a great animal trainer I was. It took cooperation for me and my animal. Suddenly, there was a crash. I looked outside, they were setting up the tents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; My name is George Gates and I am an animal trainer at this circus. I have been training since I was 8. Like I said earlier, today was a big day for me. At 7:01 I go down to the pie tent(where I eat breakfeast), then I go back to my tent to change into my circus clothes. At 8:00 the big circus tent is set up and I do a rehearsal. Then at 9:00 we all relax after our rehearsal. I am100% sure I won't make mistake. Then the clock ticks 9:00, We got down to the circus tent and then a bus full of people arrive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Although my heart is in my throat, I walk straight up to them to greet and welcome them. I can tell by their faces they are eager to watch the circus show. Soon more and more people arrive and soon there are more than an 100 people. We take them toward the circus tent.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;My heart is still in my throat. They seat themselves and I perform to them. Showing my circus love I perform without making a mistake.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then it is soon evening I ahve performed all lot.

You may think circus life is crazy and easy however it is really difficult.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We have school at 9:00. Like any school we have computers, tests, and report cards however there is lots of diversity with many cultures like Russian, French, Italian, and Scottish just like me. Since we treavel so much our geography lessons come to life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At 3:00 school ends and then comes practice for the show. There are many ineresting parts to it however my favorite is the acrobatics.&nbsp; The we have a simple dinner at the pie car at 6:30.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At 10:00 the show is over. Boy am I tired. It was so much fun seeing all those happy faces in the audience. But now time to get some sleep.

It was Monday and we were in Africa doing a normal performance. I was having fun waiting for Joe's and my part came. The clown went out and did his magic tricks. The acrobats did their long performance. Then it was our turn to perform.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We were doing the fire act where we had to juggle juggle three thick&nbsp; sticks with fire on their edges. Then we anccidently dropped one stick and there was a enormous fire. &quot;Run!&quot; I screamed. Everyone evacuated. I tried to call the firefighters with my cellphone but they didn't understand me because they spoke a different language.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I decided to go to nearest city and get water.

There, the crew</p> <p>was setting up for today's show.</p> <p>At 9:00 A.M., I went to school. It was just like a normal school with computers,</p> <p>tests, and report cards. Since the circus performers are from all over the world, my classmates speak many different languages.</p> <p>After school is over, I take a 30-minute break. I play with the clowns' unicycles</p> <p>and juggling balls.</p> <p>Next, I do my chores and practice for the circus. I take care of our horses', the ones</p> <p>we use in our horseback acts. My dad practiced jumping off a running horse and somersaulting on the ground. I practice jumping through a hula-hoop just a little bit bigger than me. Other kids like me are practicing the tightrope. Trainers are working with many different kinds of animals.</p> <p>I eat dinner at 6:00 P.M. in the pie car, but don't eat to much since we have a show</p> <p>coming up.</p> <p>In the show, we start off with a live band riding on unicycles dressed as clowns.</p> <p>Next, trainers walk leopards on a leash, while the leopaords juggle three five-pound balls. After that, kids cartwheel up a ladder and dive into a pool of water. Then, a tiger leaps up to the top of a ladder and does monkey bars. Finally, my part and my dad's part comes. My dad starts the horse while I started charging towards the hula-hoop. I jump through the hoop and jump onto the running horse. Meanwhile, my dad jumps off the horse and does two backwards canon-balls in mid-air and a backwards and forwards flip on the ground. After all this, I drive the horse through an obstacle course where dad holds the obstacles.</p> <p>After the show, everyone claps and applauses for us. We are exhausted and go to</p> <p>bed late at night. The whole circus crew was ready to travel to another place after a good night's sleep.</p>	2		20131021155318	537	2		20131022100351	690	2

First Pablo has to wake up get dressed and take a shower all before 7:00 A.M. Next he goes to eat at a car called, &quot; Pie car.&nbsp; In the pie car a perfect breakfast of pancakes with bacon. After he`s done he goes to school at 9:00AM and finises at 3:30PM. Next he does his chores and practices his circus act. At 6:30 PM it`s diner time,and his meal is at the pie car. He can` eat much because he`s about to preform.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It preforming time for Pablo and he has the butterflies! First the ring master goes out on stage and welcomes everyone on stage. He announces all the acts to the stage. then the time comes when he says,&quot;Pablo.&quot;&nbsp; Pablo was so nervous his palms were sweating. Pablo was an acrobat and his partner was a girl. He was afraid because at practice he dropped her doing a&nbsp; triple&nbsp; back flip double back twist spine breaker. From that day on Pablo was terrified of dropping her. Pablo went in to the stage and climbed a ladder to get the swing and prayed to the heavens to give him power to carry his partner. After he did that he felt stronger and he carried Susan. The crowd went wild.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the circus Pablo was so tired and was happy he did n`t drop Susan. Pablo's whole family told him he did a great job.</p>	2		20131022120002	693	2		20131022152632	562	2

Just then I felt something nudging gently into my leg. I turned around to face a fully grown king cobra!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;C'mon Triss,&quot; I frowned. &quot;You know you can't get attention by interrupting. I'll be with you in a minute. Triss made a face, but slithered away quietly. I worked with Changhao on his lunges and then turned to Triss. After the day was over, I lay in bed thinking. My name is Keith, Keith Reyes. I am an animal trainer at the <u>Classic Carnival</u>, a very successful circus that has thier last show of the American tour coming up in a week. It's a big deal, and the circus promoter will be there. My animals and I are a big part of it and that puts a lot of pressure on me. Best not to worry about it, I thought and fell asleep.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up early, at 5:00, and made my way to the pie car. The cook there, Zachary, was an early morning person, and knew I was too. &quot;Hey there,&quot; he said. &quot;I got some pancakes for both of us to eat. And I also got some tidbits for your animals.&quot; By the way, Zach loves my animals, and they love him back. I chuckled and we made our way to my cart to eat. After that, I set about teaching my newest animal, a bald eagle, some tricks. In all, I have only three animals, but they are the best three animals one could have. Soon my eagle, which I named Leatho, could do a rolling dive, a barrel flip, and had been trained only to bite people who hurt him first. I looked at my watch. It was already lunch! Zachary and I headed to the pie car and Zachary immediately whipped up an all-you-can-eat buffet.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, when I lay in bed, I was content with my training.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the day before the circus! Everybody was rushing, but not me. I had trained my animals well, and we had already rehearsed our performance several times in front of the stage crew. But late in the night, while I was giving my animals their dinner. I saw a darkened shape out of the corner of my eye. I did not sleep well that night.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up even earlier to do some last minute practice. But when Zachary and I came in, we found the pet yard empty! Just then I noticed some footprints. I followed them into a large tent, while Zach alerted the others. I had never seen that tent before. I quietly slipped into the folding of the tent and saw two men talking. Animal smugglers! With my animals in cages. Rage welled up inside me but I forced myself to stay calm. Those men had guns. I slipped out and found the rest of the circus actors.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told them where my animals were and what I was going to do. It was showtime!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I slipped int the folds of the tent again and chirped like a cricket. Leatho knew that signal and began banging on the cage. The men came over to quiet it while Triss stretched and stretched, and made herself thinner and thinner and got out! Triss, however, went to the bottom of Changhao's cage. Changhao started hooting like a madman and the men grouched over. Changhao immediatley layed them flat with a cross chop while Leatho picked his lock. Leatho them barrel rolled into the men and started pecking them. After doing them justice, he went and picked Changhao's lock. The men saw this and started getting up. But then Triss slithered over, with his hood spread wide. The men, their eyes wide with terror, freaked out and ran out of the tent as fast as the could, where they met the rest of my crew along with the police.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police, who had been called by my crew, disarmed and handcuffed the men.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, my animals performed the same trick beautifully on two able-bodied men. The crowd went wild and the circus promoter signed us on another American tour. I went to sleep that night felling happer than ever before.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022153224	539	2		20131022161326	556	2

It is so cool! It looks so scary when they fly off and then go to the next bar!But when they were new and they were practing they would always fall of and be depressed but they sty strong and say <b>&quot;I will achieve this goal!</b>After years or months passed they are great!That is what is like being a person on a trappeze!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Paragraph is about juggling.Have you ever tried to juggle? Well if you haven't try now!</p> <p>It is hard?<b>Ehh?</b>You juggle balls or pie or anything!As Like swords<u> (WOW) </u>or chain saws <u>(DANGER) </u>These jugglers have hard times. They have to practice WAY&nbsp; more then any others.That is why maybe jugglers have so much fun.That is my paragraph about juggling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is about acrobats.Those acrobats you proabably have seen looks so cool!Did you know that they do somersaults?They also launch from cannons, And tight rope walk? So scary!You are up so tall when you are looking down there probably isn't any safety when you fall down and you can break probably your body bones.That is what it is like being in a acrobat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I Jenny Kim shall be telling you about the ring masters.The ring masters are the hosts of the circus. Then they announce who is going to come out next.The ring master shouts all day.TIRING!He has a special costume that is more natural then the rest of the acts.Then at the end of the show the ring master puts on an amazing show with the horses!Wouldnt that be exciting?That is what the ring masters dresses and does.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this is what most of the kids know from all the circuses.The clowns! The clowns entertain every audience.They ride in tiny little cars and always act silly!<b> hehe</b> The clowns throw pies and wear big pants!they wear so much make-up you don't even know whos who!?But guess what the clowns actaully learn they dont do whatever they want because that would create a mess.So that is why they practice how they should do it and not how to do it. That is what clowns do and what goes on clowns.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I shall tell you about the animal trainers.These animal trainers are lucky but their job is risky.The animal trainers train animals.<b>Of course!</b> The animals train&nbsp; monkeys,seals,elephants,leopards, snakes, lions, annd horses.They have danger hazard so they have to have medicine or someone who cures people like doctors. The animals have fun jumping through hoops and jumping very high.They sometimes make the tigers jump in the hoop of fire!Wow~!That is what&nbsp; the animals do and what the trainers do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the stage hands you can never forget!If you never had them you would have no circus and you need help putting up the tent. They also help by just calling saying <b>&quot;you are almost next.&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;you are next, Hurry!&quot;</b>They get the animals ready for the show and sometmes they have to clean the animals poop.<b>eww~</b>They also groom the animals and get their manes or hair ready for the nights show. Those are reasons why we need to have stage hands in the circus for help.</p> <p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I hope you had a nice time reading my essay because this may help you on a report.I hope you had fun reading the ones in the circus you like by the way did you like my essay?I hope this helps you because it would be a honor to me.Thank you and Goodbye~</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>~The End~</b></p>	2		20131023213915	545	2		20131024102315	693	2		20131025145034	539	2

It's busy because you have to get dressed, eat, go to school, have a quick break, you have chores to do, practice your performance, and finally perform.

I work at the circus named Lots 'o' Fun. I work as an animal trainer, but my favorite animal to train are the leopards.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My favorite animals to train are the lepards, because they are adorable. Also, because they are very unique and it's not like training a dog. However, you need to help them practice enough so they don't forget what they are doing in the middle of a performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many leopards, but here are some of their names, Lola, Daisy, Dotty, and Smarty. The trick that the audience loves the most is when they jump through hoops. Right now we have 3 leopards in training. Their names are Sky, Rolo, and Taliver.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the people I travel with are Carl and Anne, the Circus clowns. Also, there is Terri, Carla, Andrew, Patty, and Carrie, our acrobats. My closest friend I travel with is Tonya, a fellow animal trainer. Sometimes the trailer can be very tight with everybody in there.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My least favorite things to do are working from sun-up to sun-down, so, you only get a little sleep. Also, it's hard being away from my family for so long and not having friends for a long time because you keep moving to different cities. Then, there is also having to eat out of a pie car every night.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So, sometimes the circus life can be great, but sometimes it can be very rough. That is about my life traveling with the Lots 'o' Fun Circus, many fun people, and the best animals! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023162629	552	1		20131024102315	693	2		20131025145034	539	2

That was fun. I just came back from the circus. Have you ever been? Well if you have cool!!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to know my my favorite part of the circus is. Well I will tell you, it is all the different types of animals doing all different types of tricks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All animals are funny and cute but my real favorite is the monkeys and elephants. I like it when the elephants do the special tricks close to the end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst part to me is having the circus over and go home, but the good thing is that it lasts pretty long i say about a few hours.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When i have the chance to get tickets though i try my hardest to get as many as i can get cause they are some big bucks. So it is hard to get a lot of tickets if you don't have that much money or if you have enough money to get more than one you can try but don't waste your money on whole lot of tickets or you will be out of luck.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So next time you go to the circus tell people what your favorite part of the circus is.

You might hurt yourself if yo do something wrong during practice. It is very important that you do not wear your uniform during practice because you only get one so if it rips your out of luck. There are some downfalls of being a clown like you never get to see your real family when on a tour butt you still get to call them after your praformance. Then there are good things like you get payed alot of money. So if you want to be a clown just keep these things in mind.</p>	1		20131022120016	935	2		20131022161226	690	1		20131024112322	552	1

1062	AI-XC	20131118131242	1500	1500	B	N	N	F	595854	5	10476875	Y	56196	<p>What Happens At A Circus</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Have you ever been to a Circus?&nbsp; Well, If you have'nt I'm going to tell you all about one!&nbsp; The circus is a fun colorful place full of&nbsp; interesting people and animals.&nbsp; A circus is where people come from different states to perform a show for&nbsp; you.&nbsp; A circus is also a place where you can enjoy watching unusual acts and laugh at different things.&nbsp; A circus also has animals that preform tricks for you such as, Jumping through hoops, Standing on two feet, And danceing.&nbsp; Also there are acrobats who preform different stunts hanging on ropes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First, Circus clowns, Circus clowns are funny people wearing makeup and big floppy shoes.&nbsp; You may have seen a clown at your circus and if you have'nt here are some common details a clown has, Big floppy shoes, Curly fluffy hair, Silly makeup, And a funny outfit.&nbsp; Clowns are nice and often play jokes on other clowns.&nbsp; Jokes are funny to clowns here are some common jokes they play, Pie in the face, water in the face, and loud music in their ears.&nbsp; Clowns are funny but scary at times to me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, Circus acrobats, Circus acrobats are cool interesting people.&nbsp; They preform tricks on ropes and flip in the air.&nbsp; Acrobats are like professional ballet dancers but on ropes.&nbsp; They twirl and slide on ropes to make people think they are going to fall wich leaves them in suspence.&nbsp; Also, Acrobats have to trust their partner or they might put the partner's life in danger.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Third, Circus juggler,&nbsp; Circus jugglers throw different objects it the air and toss them in a circular motion makeing them come into each hand evenly and the cycle continues on.&nbsp; Circus jugglers toss things such as, Rings, Sticks, Animals, And balls.&nbsp; Juggling&nbsp; requires only one person but you can have at least four in a group.&nbsp; Jugglers usualy wear puffy red, White, Or blue shirts to make them look interesting.&nbsp; Also, Jugglers may do tricks while juggling they might flip or ride on a unicycle while they are juggling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Fourth, Circus tightrope walker, Tightrope walkers walk on ropes that are conected to two platforms one is where the walk begins and one is where the walk finishes.&nbsp; The tightrope walker has a very dangerous job in the circus they walk on a rope several feet above the ground.&nbsp; Even though the rope is high up they usualy have a net hoisted above the ground just incase they fall.&nbsp; Tightrope walkers can also do more stunts with their job to make it more interesting and dangerous.&nbsp; Tightrope walkers can ride motorcycles on a rope, Jump on the rope, And sometimes spin on the rope.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, Circus horses, Circus horses are fun animals that usualy jump up and down.&nbsp; Circus horses have to listen to their trainer or they will be excused from the circus.&nbsp; If the horses are not trained they might go crazy and hurt somebody.&nbsp; The people who preform with the horses might jump on their backs or stand on their backs as a trick.&nbsp; The horses are usualy black or white to make them stand out.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Later, The circus tent, The circus tent is where everything goes on, the entire show depends on the tent.&nbsp; The circus tent is the basic traveling home of the circus people.&nbsp; The circus tent is wide and tall like a small house.&nbsp; The tents are usualy white and red or white and blue depending on the type of circus.&nbsp; The circus tent takes a while to put up if you do not have the right kind of help with you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, The circus lifestyle, The circus life isnt all fun and games all the time.&nbsp; You have to work all day and all night all the time even on weekends!&nbsp; Circus performers don't get alot of sleep either they have to be up around six or seven A.M. and the noght before they were up until like twelve P.M. so the few hours they get to sleep is pure gold to them.&nbsp; How their day starts is go to the pie car to get food for breakfast, Get dressed, Practice for a while, Go to the morning show, Then practice for the matinee.&nbsp; Pretty harsh living style but the preformers say its all worth it!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After that,&nbsp; Chores a young circus performer has to do, First, they clean animal stables I think that job would be disgusting becaus the animals use the bathroom there.&nbsp; Then they groom the animals to prepare them for the show.&nbsp; Next, they feed the animals so they don't get hungry during the show and eat the straw scattered on the ground.&nbsp; After that, they practice for the upcoming show so they can do a perfect job and please the audience.&nbsp; Later, They let the animals rest so they will be well rested for the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Then, Traveling school,&nbsp; Their school is like no other it travels with them on their trips to different countrys.&nbsp; It may get hard at times becaus other kids on the school trailer speak different languages and you can not understand what they are saying.&nbsp; Also when they travel all around the world they see the different cultures that the states have and that makes the lessons come alive.&nbsp; The school isn't much different from regular schools it's just on wheels.&nbsp; The school makes it to where the circus children have education while they are on the road.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Last,&nbsp; Circuses are fun at times and hard living at times to.&nbsp; Would you ever give up seeing your family for the circus life?&nbsp; I would never do that becaus without my family I would be upset.&nbsp; Circus life is different from a regular life it has its up sides its down sides and the sides that are just right.&nbsp; This concludes my report about the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022162212	543	2		20131022202314	545	2

I was trying to be and acrobat, but it was hard. My partner Manuel is helpng me how to be a good acrobat. Manuel taught me 24/7 until I was ready for my debut.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, my debut came I was so nervous about my first circus show. I was also afraid that I was going to mess up. All the pressure came to me. I waited, waited, and waited until it was Manuel and me. It was our turn to go on next. The clown introduced me to the crowd.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd went wild when they heared that it was my debut. when I went on my stage, I did what I needed to do, which was to entertain the crowd.There were so many people watching the circus, more pressure came. When I went on my first jump I swinged and jumped off. Then, Manuel caught me and put me back on my swing.I couldn't belive I made my first jump.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I saw my boss smiling at me, I was happy. Happy enough to do my second jump with confidence. So I went off. Good thing there was a net underneath me because i fell, good thing that nothing was hurt. When I was on the net, I springed up and went on my swing and tried my 360 jump again. I did it and Manuel caught me. Everybody was amazed that I made my second jump. They don't know that i have 4 jumps.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got back from my ledge, Manuel and I jumped at the same time and did our frontflips off our swings. All of the crowd loved us. Finally, it was my 4th jump. I have to do a backflip while doing a 360. My last jump was hard I missed my first try and my second try. You know what they say third time is the charm. I swinged off my edge and looked at the crowd. They were amazed what Manuel and I were doing. We jumped off the same time, and did our 360 backflip. We got each other's swings and landed on the ledge.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got down, we ave each other a high five. We went to our boss and wanted to know how we did. He said great. We were so happy we gave each other another high five. Oh man I can't wait to go back and do the same thing what we did at the end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we waited to jump again before the crowd goes home.We needed to get water so we will not be thirsty. After an hour, all of the member went on. We did our acts again all at once. It was so cool and there was confetti. We all bowed to the crowd and said goodnight. I was so sad that the crowd was not here, but couldn't wait for the other crowd for next week.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't believe that the crowd rated the shoe 5 out of 5 stars. My debut was a success and I did a really good job on my debut day. After this month I have to go to Florida. I can't wait to go in the beach and have fun. Everybody couldn't believe that I only had 6 months to get ready for today and all that work payed off.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023164402	562	2		20131024113855	545	2		20131025103349	543	2

Exept before they could do the show they had to find a clown which was the main part of the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus put up a sign up sheet for a clown job. On the first day everybody signed up it seemed like.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then when it came to be adition day only two people showed up. It was kind of disappointing ,but it gave the judge a easier choice. The people that had signed up to be a clown were named after Babe Ruth the famous baseball player and Usher. They were both a good clown and definately not shy to a strangers face.</p>	1		20131023163857	541	1		20131024102425	690	1		20131025144758	543	1

Ok back to the story, I'm getting ready for the big show in Toon Town and then I over hear my boss saying that there is a new person in the circus.then i whisper to myself &quot; I wonder who that is going to be?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour later, Bob saw the new person in my boss'ss room and guess who it was. Roger Rabit!!!&nbsp; Roger came out of the room and said, &quot; hello&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I said, &quot; Oh, you are the new person.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have some experience in being a tightrope walker,&quot; Roger said</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I replied &quot;Then lets see it.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 3:45 and the show started at 6:00. Roger got up on the tightrope on a little bike. He just rode back and forth on the little bike . he came down and said to Me &quot; How about that did you like it?&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; Not really.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's 5:45 and now I'm starting to get worried that maybe Roger won't get it right. Now it is 5:55&nbsp; and the show is about to start. Now it is 6:00, let the show begin! I go out and I look up at Roger and saw him standing where he was suppost to be and then they put the spotlight on him and then he started to do back flips on it then for the grand finale he did a wheelie on a little bike.</p>	2		20131023132239	690	1		20131023194213	562	1		20131025102050	543	2

My family consists of my brother Eric, my sister Mile y, my parents and me. My day starts with breakfast in the pie cart and then school starts. My brother is in the high school class and my sister is in preschool. I am in middle school in 6th grade. I go to a special trailer every morning to the sixth grade class which consists of 3 boys and 4 girls, including me. After school I play with my cat Sunny and do my homework. Next I practice my craft.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am a trapeze artist and right now I am practicing flipping off a trapeze and into another trapeze. It requires a lot of skill and patience. My dad is working on his clowning skills and my mom is working on the tightrope. She is preforming a difficult trick in&nbsp; which she must ride two unicycles stacked on top of each other while on a string tight rope suspended 50 feet in the air. My brother is working on a trick in which he is thrown out of a cannon and my sister is working on doing a flip off a trampoline. My friends do acrobatics and trapeze. Then we have dinner and get into costumes. Mine is a sparkly green costume.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The show begins! I do a trick which I learned a long time ago: doing a handstand on my friend'ss head while she is sitting on a trapeze holding a pole which my other friend walks on to get to our trapeze. She then hangs on the seat of the trapeze while it lowers and I get off.</p> <p>The show ends and I walk back with my family, tired as a sloth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It'ss midnight and I am in bed. I wonder what it is like to be a regular kid, about to see me preform tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161304	541	2		20131023133153	562	2

Also they have circus horses. The horses do tricks in front of the audients.but mostly they get riden on by the workers at the circus. also the tightrope walkers they walk on thin ropes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At the circus they also have acrobats that perform. The acrobats do stunts that are hard to do . But not for them because they practice alot to get it just perfect that way they do not get hurt. The circus also has clowns. I do not like clowns but i am sure other people like them .but i dont like them. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Outsides of circus they have food games all sorts of things . they even have jumpers. &nbsp;&nbsp; some times they dont have jumpers. mostly they dont have jumpers .as you can see the cicus is not so bad but i still do not like circus. even though i dont like circus i&nbsp; am sure that other people like the circus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022161226	690	1		20131023130336	541	1

Ashley is 16 years old and her parents own the circus. Ashley basically lives at the circus because shes always at one or on the road. Shes home schooled her parents want her to perform with the tigers but shes so nervous and scared. Her parents told her if she doesn't come up with a act in two days. Ashley's going to have to work with the tigers and is not going to have the choice.</p> <p>&nbsp;The next morning she woke with her clown pajamas on ate a bowl of cereal bacon and four pancakes. When your in the circus you have to be full so you don't get so hungry. Also make sure have a good breakfast. Then she went to the gym in her pajamas the clowns were laughing at her. Ashley worked out for a while then got ready. They got on their trailer and left while she was riding in the trailer she was thinking about her performance. While she was traveling&nbsp; then she decided what she was going to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When they got to the circus they set up the tents and decorations. Ashley ran to her parents and told them what she wanted to perform. She wanted to perform on the trapedes her parnets agreed. Her mother said its going to take alot of practice. Ashley practice for 7 hours everyday and finally mastered it. The show started at 8pm Ashley was practing. Ashley's mother brought in a real live tiger and told Ashley to get on top of it. Ashley was nervouse she got on the tiger she wasn't scared anymore. Her mother siad your going to have to do two acts.</p> <p>&nbsp;Ashley agreed with her mother then it was showtime she did excellent with the tigers her parents were so proud of her . It was the last show and she performed great. It was time to leave for the summer and Ashley misses the circus so much.</p>	1		20131022100547	556	1		20131022120003	693	2		20131023210111	543	1

As we travel all over the world, our geography lessons are great help.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3:00 p.m. School has just got out.

I sometimes get bored, but I can always entertain myself.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3:30 p.m. We practice what we are going to do tonight for the circus and do chores. The chores can be really boring like I have to pick up the elephants' poop and feed the elephants. I have to practice my acts like riding on the unicycle and juggling. Trainers are doing training with the animals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>6:30 p.m. Dinnertime. We eat a small meal before we perform our show because we could get cramps and we are performing tonight. We do 8 shows a week. One eack weekday, and two on each Saturday and one on sunday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>10:30 p.m. The show is over. I am exhausted after a big show.We pass the circus offices, concession stands, stables, and trailers.

Doing things like that that are just God given talent.&nbsp; You might think it looks easy but trust me it isn't.&nbsp; Although it is fun it is a lot of hard work. To achieve goals that you make in the circus are always fulfilled.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After a show you will probly be very exuasted. But that realy doesn't matter in the circus. You are very happy with how you did but you fall out when you are done. Hearing those people cheer is just a dream come true. you absolutly love it. I know I did on my very first show. it was great and i thought i did great also.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022092732	935	1		20131022120057	537	1		20131023111805	552	1

He's our portable trashcan when I would get the last piece of pie he would eat the crust, when my dad wasn't looking I tossed him a price of my broccoli.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day of the circus I would do some extra practices when no one is looking I start on the trapies, but I have to be very quiet bcause I don't wan't to wake up the lions or the monkeys. But I don't want to wake up my dad for sure so thats the life of me in the circus. Ectspet the part of trying to get out of the trapies when everone is awake thats the hard part of it. Thats when having a hole in the side.</p>	1		20131023164426	562	1		20131024102637	541	1

Lewis and i'm going to teLl you about life in a Circus. Life in a Circus is very difficult, but not for me because I have been in the Circus for 15 years. I started when I was 7 years old, I wanted to do it because my parents has their own circus, so once I saw them doing </b><b>acrobats I knew from the beginning that's what I wanted to do. I trained for 3 years and when I turned 10 it was my first performance. The performance I had to do was walking on a horse back while it was running. At first I was very scared but then I saw my father show me what I had to do before showtime&nbsp; to refresh my memory and then I noticed it wasn't that scary after all. It was 5 minutes before show</b>, <b>I was next. Before I went on my father wished me good luck and it was time for me to go on.</b><b> As I walked onto the platform I noticed how many people came just to watch the Circus, then I said to myself I can't mess up or my parents reputation will be ruined. So, after all I performed my act and I landed it it was perfect everyone loved it. I have been doing the Circus every since.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I've told my story so it's time for me to tell you the types of training you wil have to do for your entrance in your life in the Circus.</b></p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to be in the Circus you will have to be fit and in shape. You will have to take contortionist and acrobat lessons. Most of all you will have to be determined to do it and not quit and that's how you will get the performing act. I'm gonna tell you only a fewjobs they are gonna have there just incase you will want to do one and I will tell you what types of trainings you will have to do with them</b><i>.</i></p> <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first job I am going to tell you about is acrobats. In order to do acrobats you will have to have great balance and posture. Next, you will have to be in shape and have lots of flexability. The types of training you will have to do is just learnong how to do certain moves and how to hold your self in the air with nothing holding you. Then, you will have to learn how to flip and spin in the air and that's how you do acrobats in the air without nothing holding you but a rubber-band like object that you will have to hold on to in order not to fall out of the air and this will take lots of strength.</i></p> <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next job I am going to tell you is about traing lions. To train lions you have to be very brave and have the animals to like you. Warning: If the animals do not like you stay away from them and try to stay calm. The type of training </i>you will have to take is only classes on how to get the animals to do what you say and it will take lots of practice to get the animals to like you.

But then her mom grabed one out of a familier bag and put it on. So Cindy found another bag and put the costome on witch fit and followed her mom witch looked like she was waiting in a long line for something then heard her mom call out,&quot;Millie, where are you.&quot; Then someone replied in the dreeing room, be there in a minute.&quot; But no one came and her mom said,&quot;Oh, i didnt realize you got here Milie,&quot; and grabed her hand and pulled her out in the show ring. Then she said ,&quot;run and jump high,&quot; so she did what her mother said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cindy ran as fast as she could and jumpped the next thing you knew she was spinning in a circle with her mother holding her up.

Then her mom said,&quot; Cindy is that you?&quot; Cindy responded,&quot; Yes, mommy, its me Cindy.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the show was over Cindy and her mom had a talk about how good she did and then her dad came and everybody did a little dancew of joy.

He was inside the helicopter which would take them to the circus. They put the elephants inside the back of a train which takes them to the circus as well. Many other things were put in the train. As well as costumes, baloons, food and water supplies and many other things. The helicopter would take them to the circus. Beginning now the rotors began to spin, and the train's engine was steaming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Both of the transports took off, with 120 miles to travel. once in paris, the helicopter landed. The train came up the slope to a stop 20 minuets later. Everyone got ready for the big day at the paris national circus, which was tommarow. The people got out and trained for their' acting postions. Hudson, getting out of the helicopter, welcomed the others that had arrived in the train. Hudson was nervous as they enter The giant tent, filled with many people. Over 17,000 People filled the seats. The actors got ready as chinook helicopters dropped supplies from a rope. Hudson picked up the clown suit from the care package. They all walked inside the tent as the helicopters flew away.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>An hour later...</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The acts were very good. Everybody clapped and cheered. Then hudson's act started. Hudson didn't show up. The crowd grew silent. Dead silence filled the Tent. Hudson was on his computer. But the time was fast on his computer. The crowd, booing, yelling and waiting for hudson's act was angry. Hudson then remembered he forgot to change the time! It wasn't 5:00, it <b><b><u>was </u></b></b>6:00! Hudson then ran for the door to the stage. The clown was rushing to the acting grounds. But the crowds were throwing <b><b><u>Tomatoes! </u></b></b> It was like a battlefield out there. The poor clowns had tomatoe splatters all over their expensive suits! Then, the lion cage opened and the scary lions ran wild! It was a <u>disaster!</u> The clowns Ran to the dressing room and yelled at hudson. The clowns then grabbed throwing pies and headed for the stage. But the crowd was gone. Just gone. They had left! But there were still two people. He said he wanted to see an act. So now was their time. They got ready. They put Woods in a container and hudson got a saw. He cut the box. Woods was seperated! The two people liked the act and asked if they could do a few more tricks. They said yes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The next month...</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The circus called &quot;<b><u>Pieday&quot;</u></b> was a hit! They were famous!&nbsp; All the people wanted to win front row seats to see them. They were going to Russia To perform next. They all loaded up in the helicopter as they took off. They were gonna be a great group! The chinook landed in russia and everybody liked them! This was very good! People of all over the world cheered and clapped for pieday circus group. And one day Woods the clown got called to go to a famous child's birthday! This was great! Woods was a tightrope walker. Hudson was a clown, an acrobat and a great juggler. He could perform multiple things. Thousands of circus Chinooks flooded the skies on the day of the birthday. Trucks that were red carried supplies on the streets. This was a big thing. The mansion was about 36 floors high. THAT'S BIG. Once there the clowns got all the supplies and the whole day went well.

I could here birds chirping outside and my mom cooking breakfast downstairs. I had been anticipating this day for months now. I couldn't wait to go to the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I lived far out in a small country town and the circus hadn't come in a long time. My family had a farm and we had many animals but my favorites were horses. My mom once said to our neighbor that I had a real gift with the horses. I knew every thing about them. I had once heard that the circus that was coming had the most amazing horses in the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Later at the circus we bought our tickets and walked in. The tent was ginormous! It was red and white striped and seemed to go on forever. We quickly took our seats and waited for the show to start. Suddenly a man in stilts walked onto the stage and started speaking in a&nbsp; low voice.&quot; I am sorry but our opening act, the horses, has been canceled due to our sick horse master&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was filled with disappointment and wanted to cry. I could see the horses back in the other room stamping impatiently and wondering where their master was. Suddenly the man on the stilts seemed to remember that this was not in a big city and that most people would own farms and know how to command a horse.&nbsp; So the man said,&nbsp; &quot;Although, if anyone knows how to work with a horse we could have them train for a day and you could come back tomorrow.&quot; No one was very happy about the fact that they would have to come back tomorrow, not even the performers. They knew it would set back the scheduling for the tour. But they didn't want to disappoint anyone who had paid to see their show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I wasn't even listening to the announcer because I was too sad and lost in thought. But my mom suddenly stood up and said, &quot;My daughter has a wonderful talent with horses, she could do it!&quot; Every one started laughing. The thought of a little girl tending the horses in a circus was just absurd. Despite all the laughter, no one else volunteered. I was going to work in the circus with one of the most amazing horses in the world! I was so excited.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Later that afternoon, I started to work with the horses. It was very easy in the beginning but then I learned how to orchestrate much more complex tricks with the horses. I learned that I wouldn't actually be on the horse but that I would just be giving the horses commands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next day at the show, I got very nervous. Although I had been training non-stop yesterday I still had butterflies in my stomach. Before I knew it, I was walking onstage with the magnificent white horses. The lights started to dim and it seemed like all eyes were on me. I started my first trick. The show was simple at first but throughout my act the tricks got harder and harder. Finally I was finished. I turned and took a bow. I thought I saw out of the corner of my eye the horses bow their long graceful necks too. Everyone started applauding. I was filled with energy and happiness. That was the day I saved the circus. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024113830	935	2		20131025081934	562	2

She can balance on a balance beam and even and straight with books on her head (I think that is only a plus though).Katleen is someone that can really be the best at anything.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day she was walking in the park with three other friends that were dear to her heart.They stopped by a refreshments stand to get some ice cold water when there it was.The poster for the&nbsp; new opening in the Cirque Du Soleil.They had heard about it on the news but didn't know they could have a chance.All three girls tore a slip off with the information on it.Katleen really wanted this job as a kid she was always watching the circus with her mom and dad but today she has a shot at being in the circus and having kids watching her perform.She was so excited but then she read that each entry needs to have a opposite gender partner to be able to try out.She automatically thought of her friend Devin.He was her best friend and they would be a perfect pair.Devin was also her crush.She really thought that he was cute but everyone thought she was silly.Right then and there she pulled out her phone and called Devin.He picked up in excitement. He said, &quot;You'll never guess what!I just found a sign up sheet for the&nbsp;Cirque Du Soliel today when i was in the park walking Sally.Do you wanna be my partner.&quot; &quot;Yes Devin I'll be your partner.That's exactly what I wanted to ask you too so i guess you beat me to it.&quot; said Katleen in a happy voice.The two met up in the park and started to practice right away doing back flips,side aerials,and cartwheels.They looked lovely together let's just hope they can pull it off in three days or all that work is just trash.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days passed and today is the day.Devin and Katleen both met up in the parking lot of the try outs and walked in together as a pair.The two went to the bathrooms and got on their leotards and Katleen got on her tutu.They came back out and got someone to go and take a picture of them in their outfits so that they remember this day forever.About an hour later the pair was called up to get onto the ladder to get on the&nbsp; rope for acrobats.They both were very nervous.They stepped out on the stage and the music started.Their piece was titled &quot;Butterfly&quot;They got back down the ladder and hugged each other to death.They really did do their best and they both knew it.They were the tenth to last couple to perform.After the end the judge called out&nbsp; the top three.&quot;Kevin and Destiny in third place.Niall and Hailee in second place.Finally Katleen and Devin in first place.&quot;The couple jumped up and started screaming at once that means that they won the competition.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Devin and Katleen both woke up extra early the next Monday to get ready to get on the bus to go to the circus. When they got there everyone was so welcoming to them. They fit straight in with the crowd everyone accepted that they were the new people to their team.When Devin and Katleen got there they ran their routine with all the other people in the circus.Katleen thought that it would be all fun and games until she actually got there </p> <p>and experienced what it was like to be in the circus.Devin wasn't getting off at the right foot.Everyone loved and hated him for all the wrong reasons.His father was the person that was going to stop the circus from performing.One clown said that her was told that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was banished from the earth along with his descendents.Devin was hurt that they thought that he was going to stop them and ruin their chances of being the best.Katleen was sad for Devin.He had always had this problem since people knew who his dad was. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night Devin wrote to his mom and said he was thinking of leaving the circus forever.When Katleen heard of this she was disappointed that he didn't want to go through with his promise to never leave her alone.Secretly Katleen wanted him to leave so she can stop worrying about their friendship. She told Devin how she felt and the next day he was gone.&quot;What did I do?!&quot; thought Katleen when she read the letter.Her new partner was a guy named Niall.He was at the competition.He said that he loved her performance in the competition.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katleen finally got over Devin and just in time because her show was in three days.She and Niall looked awesome together.He loved to be an acrobat with her.She started to practice in her hotel room just so she would be perfect.She didn't even go to her own party because she was practicing.She never wanted to miss over twelve minutes of practice time.This time was very important to her.She was determined to show everyone how graceful she can be. But like every good circus performer she started to miss home.She miss her family and her dog Pepper.She could stand being away for so long.One day she decided that she wanted to leave and get a better job then being in the circus.Niall finally talked her out of it and made her think if she really wanted to sacrifice something so precise to just o she can get a better job.He said,&quot;I understand how you feel.I felt like that when i came to be with you but as you can see I'm as fine as fine can be I'm even better.&quot; Niall did have a point&nbsp; thought Katleen.I can't away something that I've worked very hard for to go to waste.She decided to buckle down and get focused on what she wanted to do and why she wanted to do it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katleen knew that her dad and mom would not approve for her to not get focused and be ready for something as big as this.The big day came the day she wanted to come all her life is finally here.The circus came and now she wanted it to be the very most special day of her career.They didn't think that Niall could perform because he was getting really sick.They were sxcared.So Kateen had to work with an unexperienced guy by the name of Gaert.He was handsome but his acrobatic skills sucked.He never knew which way to turn her but it pulled off and lolooked so unique and special that they had to love him.He brought a good experience to the show it was unique and special in a way that was also very funny.The &nbsp;Cirque Du Soliel did pretty good thanks to Katleen and her strong courage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024112824	539	2		20131024145209	541	2

One cool thing is that you get to proform with people from all over the world. Another cool thing is you get to around the country. One realy cool thing is that you get to live with all sorts of cool people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But being a circus proformer dose have its ups and downs. One down side is you have to practice all day. Another down side is you have to clean up after the animals in youre show. One really bad down side is if you get hurt during your act you could be put in a hospital.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Its not all games but its still fun to be in a cricus. One up side is durring the show you get the admeration of the entire croud. Another up side is evetually you get at least a little bit famos. The best part is you get to see places like washintonDC.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Their are some ups and downs and some things have a nutral feeling to them. One thing that has anutal feeling to me is horse bace rideing. One ofthe very best part is you dont have to pay to get in. You can get free food at the stands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once youre finised with your act you can mess around with the animals. After youre finised with youre act you can watch the rest of the show. Their are alot of things to do in a cicus like acrobatics and jugleing. So in con conlushonthir are some up s and downs to liveing in a cricus but its still fun.</p>	1		20131023132129	935	1		20131023150803	693	1		20131025110958	539	1

So like I said if I was good at basketball then I would have to be detirmined and work hard at it practice practice practice...</p> <p>&nbsp; You also would have to have the right body type. For example if you fat and your talent is being a basketball player then being fat is holding you back. You must stay fit for your talent. For example if im good a football then you should make sure you got everything down like homework and chores so that you can do your talent so your parents will let you.</p> <p>&nbsp; So if you are all of theese things then join the circus. You would make a great performer, but remember to follow all theese things dont just do it for one time and then slack off &quot;NO&quot; you must work hard throughout your carrer. If you do you would make a great employee(worker)...</p>	1		20131024102315	693	1		20131024113856	545	1		20131025150914	539	1

Then when he was old enough, he went to find a circus,and he found one! He went inside, there were clowns juggling pies and riding unicycles, acrobats on the high-wire everything was there to see! Jo went inside and asked to be a clown and the owner said &quot;Yes&quot;. Jo was in the circus! he dressed up as a clown and went inside, and there was more things inside then outside! There were people grooming the elephants and horses, and acrobats jumping from horse to horse when they were moving! Jo's act was to&nbsp; juggle with pies and jump on the trampoline! After the circus they all got paid and went home. Jo went home and fell asleep.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The next day was the same but they were going to Italy! So, every body went home and packed their things and came back in a few minutes, with things, but some people lived in Italy, most of them lived in Italy. Jo and the others went to the plane and went of to Italy! it took a day to get there because they missed a flight, but they got to Italy the next day. everybody was exited to do the circus with new people! But every body was hungry after the trip, so everybody went into the pie-car and had breakfast. then the people who lived in Italy went to there house and went to get there things.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Jo was amassed at what he saw in Italy! he saw different food and different cars. he bought a few different things and he looked at the museum paintings, then it was time to go back to the plane and go to China to perform they went to the plane station, but they missed there flight! it wasn't supposed to come back in a month! they went by car and went to China, but then they found another plane station and then went inside and was just in time to get there plane flight! the plane had to stop for fuel. then they went to China!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Jo and everybody else could see China! They landed at an airport and got out, they went to the grassy area and seted up the circus tent and they started the circus and so many people came! Jo had to sleep and ride a unicycle around the tent! So they did the act and then they went inside a SUV and went to sleep. the next morning and went to the plane station to get a ride to Seadle! They were just in time to catch the flight to Seadle!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They made it to Seadle and they put up the tent and they went to the piecar to eat. Jo was going to the tent to say &quot;Can I get paid?&quot; The owner said &quot;Yes&quot;. Jo got paid and he was going to take a break from the circus and go home. Jo said &quot;Goodbye everyone!&quot; They said &quot;Goodbye Jo!&quot; and he bought a car and went home. Jo said &quot;Im going back to the circus to be with my friend's&quot;.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023164428	562	2		20131024113856	545	2

You need to make sure that you are ready enough so you do not mess up. Even if they work at the circus they still have to go to school in order to learn. Their life is much different from ours but they still sleep eat breath they are still human beings. Circus performers have a hard life as i said they eat they dont have a dinner table exactly they eat in the pie car. To answer yur question no its not filled with pies. (trust me I thought the same thing). They cant eat alot because they have a show right after they eat. After their performes they get two days then they are off to another town.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the circus the performe alot of different things. It kinda matters who you are on what you do during the performess. Well we are going to take about the tightrope walker. His job is to practice walking on a rope up really high in the air. If that was me i would probly faint. He must really have to work hard so he doesnt fall or mess up. His job as a tightrope walker is very danerous but it does might people show up to watch. That sure can give him a nice pay check for sure.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023164428	562	2		20131024111828	537	1		20131025124345	539	1

She bought us backstage passes so we could see all of the animals and performers. I've never been to a circus before but they sound like lots of fun. My dad would have come but he's sick so we sold his ticket, but I still have to tell him what happened.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's 6:00 time to go to the circus it started at 6:30 ,but we went early to see the performers getting ready to perform it was really fun watching them get ready because we got to see the animals do a bunch of tricks like a tiger roll over and sit down all on command. Once they were done more people started to show up that's when I realized that wasn't the real show and that was just practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the real show started I was really excited because the first thing you could see on the stage was a man and a woman swinging through the air doing flips and catching each other in mid air.then under them were two clowns riding on the backs of two enormous elephants. Then a man on stilts walked right through the space in-between both elephants then a man riding horseback did a cartwheel on the horses back while the horse was running. Then all of the performers went backstage then the stage was empty, but that wasn't the end even though I thought it was it wasn't because a man with a lion came out and then another man with a tiger then they both started jumping through hoops and sitting and rolling over then they left too it was over.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we went backstage and met all of the performers even though most of them didn't speak English it was still fun i even got to feed and pet a lion. When my mom told me we had to go I didn't want to, but I knew we had to get home before it got to late so I left. When we got home I told my dad everything we did then went to bed so I could dream about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131024112722	690	0		20131024120435	693	2		20131025154720	552	1

I just could not remember where I had put it.&nbsp; I had it in my pocket before school but it is nowhere to be seen now.&nbsp; I had searched everywhere - even in the bathroom and I could not find it.&nbsp; Good thing I only needed the hook for the last act that I had so maybe I could find it on the stage during one of my other acts.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And now, we have our very own... Billy Gasten!&quot; I heard being announced.&nbsp; I got my things and hurried out onto the stage.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd roared and I waved to everyone.&nbsp; Then the music started to play.&nbsp; I waited for my cue.&nbsp; Bullzeye charged out of the curtains and towards me.&nbsp; I pretended to be scared and this was not supposed to happen and once bullzeye got close enough I jumped up and onto his back the did a front flip off.&nbsp; We had practiced this many times and the crowd loved it.&nbsp; I pretended to wipe sweat off my forehead just exaggerating a lot and actually I did wipe some sweat off my forehead.&nbsp; Bullzeye turned and charged again.&nbsp; This time he jumped up and I slid under him.&nbsp; I noticed a glint in his teeth.&nbsp; Wow I though, the dentists have been doing a good job.&nbsp; We did that a few times until the music ended. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the curtains closed and I hurried to find the hook.&nbsp; I ran out and looked again.&nbsp; I went over to the stalls first because I had been there for a while today after practice.&nbsp; I found an imprint of the hook in the grass by bullzeye's stall.&nbsp; Somebody had picked it up, but who?&nbsp; The I realized that was what had hit my ankle when I ran to Ron.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked my watch and it read 7:03.&nbsp; Time for my second act because it took about 5 minutes for the stage crew to clean up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried back to the tent and got to the stage in my position.&nbsp; Bullzeye and I did our act.&nbsp; Again I noticed a glint in bullzeye's teeth, but I thought it was only the golden tooth in the back of bullzeye's mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; After I realized that it was hopeless, I would never get the hook in time unless there was a miracle.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for the hook act.&nbsp; I waited 5 minutes and then when I was about to go out when bullzeye nudged me.&nbsp; I turned and said &quot;Not now, bullzeye&quot;.&nbsp; I turned back and started out the door but bullzeye kicked me lightly with his foot.&nbsp; I turned back and looked at bullzeye in an annoyed way. &quot;Not now bullzeye, I am not in a good mood.&quot; I said in an angry tone.&nbsp; Bullzeye spit something from its mouth.&nbsp; I looked down at the gooey thing on the ground.&nbsp; I gasped.&nbsp; &quot;Thank you bullzeye, you are the best&quot; I said happily.&nbsp; I picked the object up and wiped the saliva off.&nbsp; &quot;To Billy&quot; it read &quot;From mom and dad&quot;.&nbsp; The metal with wood reflected all the fun moments I had with my parents.&nbsp; I ran out onto the stage ready to do anything.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the crowd quieted down I announced &quot;Everybody, there will be one change in the show tonight.&nbsp; Give us 5 minutes and we will be ready again.&nbsp; I walked back and pulled the curtains shut.&nbsp; I called to the stage crew and told them specific orders.&nbsp; &quot;Get the swing fulcrum raised 20 feet without changing the length of the rope and put the trampoline near it.&nbsp; Get this done in five minutes.&quot;&nbsp; Nobody objected and they all hurried off to get the tools required. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life for a circus man is always challenging.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went over to bullzeye.&nbsp; &quot;All right bud, we are changing the plans.&quot; I said aloud and whispered the rest to him so it would be a suprize for everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed something on his neck and left.&nbsp; I gathered everyone up next &quot;Everybody there has been a change of plans.&nbsp; You might want to go out to the bleachers and watch this.&quot;&nbsp; I informed.&nbsp; Everyone did as told.&nbsp; I stretched my body out to get ready.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullzeye came over to me and we walked onto the stage.&nbsp; Everything was in place.&nbsp; The curtains opened, the music started to play.&nbsp; I hopped on bullzeye and we set off.&nbsp; You know how I said I was the fastest in the company, well, correction, Bullzeye is the fastest in the company.&nbsp; We ran like the wind to the trampoline and as we got 5 feet away I yelled &quot;JUMP!&quot;&nbsp; Bullzeye jumped and landed perfectly in the center of the trampoline.&nbsp; We flew diagonally upwards and I closed my eyes and thought.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did I use bullzeye, if we fall we both die.&nbsp; Bullzeye does not deserve to die.&nbsp; I said firmly to myself.&nbsp; Then I thought back.&nbsp; I remember the time bullzeye was born and my parents said he could be mine.&nbsp; I remember the dinner before my parents drove away to a place I am not going to now.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened my eyes and looked into the crowd and saw everybody watch in amazement.&nbsp; I was born to amaze.&nbsp; And bullzeye was born to amaze,</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The hook got on the swing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd roared.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022211022	537	2		20131023132240	690	2

There in a house a man hurrying up to drive to the market says to himself &quot;Alright lets see I need milk, eggs, and a new horn.&quot; His name is Tom Hiller. Tom is an unmarried man who works at a circus and is a clown. As Tom was in the market he met a freind who also worked with him. They met and were saying &quot;Hi&quot; to each other.Tom was finally leaving and the day was turning to night. So Tom was getting ready for the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom was putting on the white make-up and some red lipstick around and on his lips. Tom was getting used to the idea of wearing this stuff on at first he felt like a woman with a white face. As he was driving to the circus he stopped for lunch then he got back to driving. He saw a place with a huge tent with the colors of red and white. He put on his suit and got ready to work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom was riding a tiger and a small unicycle. After that Tom went home and took off everything on his face. Tom was tired and said to himself &quot; Oh boy it's been a tiring&nbsp; day!&quot; Then he went to sleep in his blankets and slept. He dreamed about how fun and hard it is working at the circus.</p>	2		20131023132129	935	2		20131023150803	693	2		20131025110958	539	2

First you need to practice doing flips and&nbsp; perfect cart wheels. Then you are going to have to work very hard to do a good job. I think we should practice at least seven times a day for a month then once you get good at it you could practice juggling in the air on a unicycle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another step that will help you be a good circus performer is making a schedule . That could really help you find the right time for practicing. You will have to practice training circus horses. You will have to practice being funny because when u are a circus performer u could choice through out a circus clown , circus acrobats, circus juggler,or circus tightrope walker.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The job that I would choose is circus acrobats. I would do that job because I love doing flips. Also because I am very flexible. Being a circus performer is a very important job. Unless you are not into it, you should not try this job out. If you really love circus then i suggest&nbsp; you try your best.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not just anyone can go and join the circus and become an acrobat or trapeze artist. A rule you should know about being a circus performer is that you can't just join the circus because you need money you could join the circus for many different&nbsp; reasons. One reason is that you like animals a lot and u want to become the person who tames the lion. Or maybe you like riding unicycles while juggling.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to become an awesome circus performer you will need to study a lot&nbsp; and practice. You will need to have a typical day to spare time.You're going to have to ask permission to your parents.I think a good book that will help you is '<b>Life's a Circus</b> by Kerrily Sapet. That is a good book because it tells you how life at a circus is like.It tells you that anyone who thinks circus life is nonstop play, is crazy.&nbsp; She had a typical day everyday. Another book is &quot;<b>Becoming a Circus Performer</b>&quot; that book is good because it tells&nbsp; you how to become a circus performer. Also if you really want to be a circus performer you should never give up.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023162610	562	2		20131024113906	537	2		20131025142508	543	2

He puts his head down like a little boy who couldn't go to his friends house. Then he shakes his head and lets the horse be.&nbsp; I do a back flip to the horse and the crowd cheers. I pet the horse then we skip off behind the curtains. We have to move very fast.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough were all out in front of the crowd and holding hands and bowing. Huge smiles are on our faces even though we are extremely tired. Then we skip back behind the curtains and take off all our make up and take our hair out of the amazing design it had.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hair is a reddish brownish color. People say it is beautiful. I think it is too. I'm only 12 years old and I'm in the circus. My parents travel with me, other wise I'll get a little home sick if there not with me.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slip on my pajamas and have a bed time snack. An apple. I love apples very much. We can only have healthy snacks so I pick apples. They rock.&nbsp; I have to get a good nights rest for tomorrow. I have a big day coming up on my heels.

You need to have a specific talent, the right body type and be very determined. Philippas road to circus stardom started when she was 5 years old. I did musical theater and ballet and all kinds of music, singing, acting and everything to hone my craft, says Philippa, who also trained in rhythmic gymnastics for years. When I was 11, I knew I wanted to be a peformer, so I went for it. I gave up everything else and concentrated on my dancing and performing.

I bet you think that being in a circus means that you can have fun all the time. Well, if you thought that you are wrong. I have to work hard every day practicing skills. I'm always busy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I go to school with all the other kids in the circus. We only have one classroom, but I'm okay with that. Some of the kids speak&nbsp; different languages, so I know four languages. I know how to speak French, German, Spanish, and English. After school I have to groom. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have to groom the horses for tonight's big show. I also have to groom a elephant! It is the smallest elephant in the world. Her name is Tiny. It's time to start practicing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I am watching my sister, Ella, fly through the air. She is a trapeze artist. It is my turn to practice. I am working with Tiny. I do handstands while she is walking I can hold a handstand for two minutes without falling! I did it perfectly. Yay! Now I'm watching my dad. He's a tightrope walker. He walks on a rope fifty feet in the air. He is so good. Now it's my mom's turn to practice then the show will start. My mom is a circus acrobat. She is so flexible it is unbelievable. We also have a human pretzel and a dancing bear! It took years to train him. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There is only five minutes until the show starts and I'm getting butterflies. I peek out to see the crowd and I faint. When I wake up I see mom. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mom is the show over?&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, you woke up just in time to do your act.&quot; I almost scream. I ran to get ready. Then I realized that I was already ready. I got Tiny and walked out to the stage. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ladies and gentlemen for your next act we have Harper Waldo.&quot; I heard the announcer say. I got on Tiny's back and did a handstand for two minutes then I picked up one hand and held it for another two minutes! Then all of the sudden I was swinging through the air with Ella. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the show we went out side and everyone wanted my autograph. I was so shocked that I said &quot;Me.&quot; Then the fans said &quot;Ya, you were awesome.&quot; So I had to sign two hundred pictures. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So my family went to our trailer and the gave me a huge bear hug. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We're so proud of you.&quot;they all said at once.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thank you. Ella I didn't know you were going to do that, but it was pretty cool.&quot; I said.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I thought I'd give the show a twist. Everyone loved it. I think we should do that for every show.&quot; said Ella. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;So do we.&quot; said mom and dad.

Life as a circus performer can be both hard and fun at the same time. In the mornings I have to wake up early to get dressed and eat breakfast. Then after that I have to start practicing for the night's show. It's not easy for me to do the tricks though. I have to have balance, concentration, and skill. This hard work is very rewarding when the crowd goes wild when I perform my tricks.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good parts of being a circus performer is great. You get to travel all over the world for circus performances and you can meet new people. To me the best part of all is when you astound the crowd. When you are break you can explore the place that you are at, learn the people who lives there's cultures, and try new food.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad part of being a circus performer is when you have to work super hard to perform at performances and basically there are performances at least once everyday from Monday to Sunday. You also have to be far away from your family for a long time. You can't call your family too because you don't have anywhere to call.</p>	2		20131023130433	556	1		20131023152450	935	2		20131025130418	552	2

It seems to be the most fun. And it fits me best. Only thing that gets me is that I have to do that every single night. With practices thats almost all day.

You should think about this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still a few more things I would like to know. Like about the pie cart. Do they serve pie?

It isn't just nonstop play, in the circus you work from sunup to sundown. Busy right?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets see what a typical day looks like for Bella Castini: 7:00 Wake up, get dressed, go to the pie cart to eat, 9:00 school time, 3:00 school's over---time for a quick break, 3:30 chores and practice, 6:30 dinnertime,7:00 SHOWTIME 10:30 the show is over and finally I am in bed at 12:00.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some upsides of being a circus performers you know like you get to travel all over the world and you get to preform in front of a live audience every time you preform endless people are watching on a TV. I think the upsides are kind of cool.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the circus there are some downsides too like circus performers work long and tiring days and they send <b>ALONG TIME </b>away from home (i think they get home sick a lot.)I don't think that sounds very fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; before you get to do all this you need to know a few things, first: not just anyone can join the circus you need to have the right body type, second: have a specific talent for some it is Circus acrobats for others it is a juggler and for some it is tightrope walking</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the words I used you might not under stand like:</p> <p>pie car: where circus performers,</p> <p>unicycle: a bike with only one wheel,</p> <p>groom: clean and brush,</p> <p>matinee: afternoon show, and</p> <p>wiped out: very tired, those were circus terms so unless you want to be a circus performer or you are a circus performer you don't have to know those terms unless you want to.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So after all those ups, downs late nights early mornings if you still want to be a circus performer and you have the right body type and a spisific talent go ahead and try to become a circus performer just try it who knows it could be fun!!!!!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br> &nbsp;</p>	1		20131022120112	541	1		20131022144146	537	1

And you have to get up everyday and get ready for your job and you train animale how to be nice and stuff or you just rain yourself how to do your magic stuff or unless you are a tightrope walker you would have to practice alot because you get hurt if you dont practice, but if your a clown you have to wake up really early and put your make up or paint on your face.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Its also about how you have to switch places at a curten time. Like at 3:30 ther are chores practice, or at 7:00 am you have to wake up and get dress up and stuff like that. When you have a circus job its going to be really hard for you, but if you think of it won't be that hard because you only have to go once if there is a circus coming out. The thing is being a circus person can be really fun for you because you can get to play with the animale and do cool magic tricks and stuff like that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the circus you need to have talent! You just cant join right away you have to have intressting things like if you were good at doing magic tricks or good at dancing and stuff like that i bet you can get the job. You have to have the right body type to join.

Everybody was going crazy! Some people wanted to see the elephants, some the clowns, and some the Trapeze artists. When we were lining up to get on the bus, i was thinking. This is my first time going to circus. It felt like forever getting there, but when we saw that big red tent when knew we were there.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we got our snacks we got our seats. I had probably about <u>three</u> slushies! So now i really had to go to the bathroom. So I went and asked my teacher , Mrs. Johnson, if i could go. I had to hurry because it was getting ready to start.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was looking for a bathroom i got lost. I found a door that I thought led to the bathroom but then I saw all these bright lights! &quot; where am I? &quot; I asked my self. A huge elephant passed by me, then a clown! Then I knew where I was. Backstage where the performers stand before they go on stage! A tall man with a mustache came up to me and asked, &quot;why aren't you changed yet!! We go out in 5 minutes! &quot; He handedd me a colorful sparkly costume to wear. So i went back and changed and it fit! Did you know how fast circus people can do your makeup and hair. It's crazy! I looked in the mirror and said to myself, &quot;wow! I look good! &quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then , I thought, Mrs.Johnson is probably looking for me! She doesn't know that im going to be in the circus. Now, im in big trouble.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 5 minutes went by and i was on the stage. People were screaming and those lights were really bright! I was looking for the class and Mrs.Johnson but couldn't find them. I had no idea what i was so supposed to do until i looked up and so people on these ropes doing tricks, hanging upside down. I thought, don't tell me I have to do that! Then that man with the mustache was telling me with his hands to go on that empty rope.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we go. They pulled the rope higher and higher! It was like I was flying! I was doing flips, twirling all sorts of stuff. It was so exciting! Then our act was over. We waited until everybody was done then we went out and bowed. People were screaming as loud as they could! It felt great.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the bow I had to go change and find my class quick! I finally found them. I was going up the stairs to my seat and they were going down the stairs. Mrs.Johnson wasn't that mad. All my classmates were saying how good I was and how it was like to be in the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never thought I would do it but I did. <u>I was in the circus!</u></p>	2		20131023130432	556	2		20131023134909	537	2

My schedules are so not necessary. All I do every day is just go around the world and do crazy things that doesn't really matter in life. I'm in Europe getting ready to perform the most crazy and not necessary things and the only human beings the only likes it are mostly kids. The grownups just thinks that it is just fake things that we do and its not the exciting to them as its exciting to the kids them selves. So what i think is what the circus clowns should do is just retire and find a job at a fast food restaurant like McDonald's. People are so UN-grateful these days with entertainment and food. Sometimes I just think of myself as an old dumb,stupid circus clown that just belongs in the circus and needs to stay.</b></b></p> <p><b>Today I have to walk on a tight rope and ride on a lion with fire on it.&nbsp; I'm going on now I'll be right back. I'm back that was a show. I stand myself corrected because i seen a lot of adults excited and enjoying the show. So i guess its just some adults who just aren't into those circus things. When i was out there I had so much fun and I was happy that almost everyone was cheering for our circus. The tight rope was really hard but i concentrated and did the best i could do and i didn't fall. The lion was a wild one but i rode on it and i was scared because i thought the lion was going to try to eat m</b>e bu<b><b>t the lion was tamed and it learned not to eat people. </b></b><b><b> Today at the circus was really good if the circus keeps going like this i would stay here until the day I die.&nbsp; Im super tired of all the things we did its time for me to go to sleep.

When we were waiting for our ride the manauger came to talk to us. He was talking about the circus because he saw how excited and scared we were. When we heard that he said maybe you six will join the circus we were excited! He told us that the interview will be on Monday and the result will be on Tuesday. After 3 days for waiting we saw our result and the six of us got in!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we packed our bag kissed our moms and said goodbye.

My Dad owns a circus and I am a big help with the horses. I help put them in thier trailers when we travel on the road, and I brush and groom them. I also train them to do very cool tricks for the shows!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, I wake up around 7:00 A.M. When I get dressed, grab some breakfast from the pie car, and go to horses while everyone sets up tents, lights, etc. By 8:30 I've fed all the horses, and now it's time to go brush my teeth and hair. At 9:00 school starts, and I am very excited to get back to the horses. Finally school's over by around 3:00. I get to the horses, and begin cleaning them up. I first fill up all their water buckets, though. I then start brushing them with a more stiff brush, and next move on to a soft brush that shines their fur a bit. I finish by putting some fly spray on them.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take a break from the horses, and complete some homework and chores. I make my small bed and make myself a little snack. While I eat, I review with myself the steps of my horseback act. Then I stop by my friends bed.&quot;Hey Jenna!&quot; I say. &quot;Want to come help me with the horses?&quot; &quot;Sorry, I can't right now, I've got to practice my quadrupel back hand spring. But I'll stop by later!&quot; She says. So I get my helmet and boots, then tell my dad to meet me in 5 minutes by the riding area, and head down.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we're both ready to practice,I put a big, white, square pad on my horse Lily, a snow white horse, with long eye lashes, and a white mane and tail, then I slip on her bridle, and hop on. &quot;Okay, lets warm up with a hand stand with Lily standing still.&quot; My dad says. I do it fine, then for about a half hour practice my back flip off her and landing it on the ground perfectly.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6:30, we eat a small dinner, because we have a show. The makeup and hair artists apply sparkly makeup, and bright lipstick. I wait about a half hour before my part comes in. I walk out on Lily and I stand up on her. I stay determined and confident, something I will always need to do here. Then I slowly swing my and back... And PUSH OFF! I curve my body back like a rainbow, then I slowly bend my knees as I land. The crowd goes wild. Every time I do this, I always smile big. Then do it again but with a double back flip. If I thought they were cheering before, well they were screaming this time! I smiled at everyone, and then walked out, the noise fading.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wiped out, I put Lily back, took of her saddle pad, and headed &quot;home&quot;.</p> <p>I put my two piece rainbow pajamas on, and waited for my dad to come home. i finished my homework, then put it in my backpack, to go to school in the morning. When i returned to the small table in our trailer cabins living room, my dad came in. &quot;Who wants hot coacoa!?&quot; he asked as he set down four cups for all the girls staying in the trailer we all gathered aroud the cups, grabbed on and sat down slurping our hot chocolate. Then we all crawled into bed, falling asleep right away.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every morning I go through the same routine. I never get tired of being with horses all day. When we are done at one destination, we drive to another, and always have a blast att the shows. I am so glad to have such a cool life. I get get to meet kids all around the world! And make new friens, every year.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023155450	935	2		20131023163909	539	2

She woke up at 7:00 a.m. got dressed and went to school there are 12 other kids that go to school some seek French others Russian but Sally she spoke English. School in the circus was like any other school it had desks and testes. After school she ate lunch at the pie car had a little break then did some chores( feeding the horses and brushing them). Dinnertime she could not eat a lot of food because of the show. The show was always fun being on stage and after seeing the people and telling us what a great job we did. In bed she thinks about home and counting the dyes until she gets to go home life in the circus was fun but at the same time sad.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months later Sally found out the next stop was her home town she could not wate to see her friends. When she got up the next morning she was in her home town, she jested wanted to run to her home but she knew she could not. At school she did not treat it as a normal day she rushed through about every thing she did that day her friends tried to slow her down but she was to excited.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That night she saw some of her friends and there family. After the show her mother said she can go with hang out with her friends. They had so much to say but they knew they did not have long so the talked and talked until there mothers called them away. sally was in bed thinking about how much things her friends and she would do when she is off tour.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she knew it it was time to go back home.

They told me that they wanted to leave and not perform tricks. I told them that if they left, then&nbsp; people will be sad. They decided not to leave. The next day the animals were not there everyone was sad. The next day people didn't go to the circus because they wanted the animals performing. The owner saw the animals gone and he called the animal control to try and find the animals . The owner didn't even care about the animals he only cared about the money. I tried to tell them that they just want to live in the wild and not in the circus. The owner just ignored me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the animal control found the animals and now they are back in the circus.

They told me that their dream is to stay in the circus. I told them that they said they wanted to be in the wild. They said they changed their mind because in the wild they are not proud. In the circus they are proud, lots of people are watching them and smiling. I just thought they wanted to be in the wild. So, the animals did really wanted to live in the wild .

Oh well I disided to keep watching and see if anything else was weird. The show continued on with nothing weird but the fire breathing, when I could of sworn he tried to toast a man or it was just me.Finally the circus was over I was so happy to have the circus over that forgot about the body. &quot;AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH&quot; their was a young woman at the body of the ring master. She looked at me then at the body&nbsp; she was speechless. As quick as a flash I calmed her down and told her everything.

Here is&nbsp; </b></p> <p>&nbsp;<b>her story.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Hello, My name is Cassidy Knoll. 4 years ago I joined the amazing life as an acrobat in the circus. My talent kind of runs in my family. I always have been proud of my family and how I live my life. Alot of people dont have the opportunities I do in life and so that makes me feel special about who I am. My entire family has these amazing talents and we are all very lucky!</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad part about being in the circus is that you are never in one place long enough to make any friends or anything like that. I enjoy making new friends and because I cant stay long enough to really make any, it isn't very good. We also dont hae many chances to really get to stay at our real house. We are always traveling. Which actually isn't a bad thing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We get up really early in the morning to go to our one-room school. But, before we do that, we have to head to our pie car, were we eat. I enjoy getting to see all the different places while we are on tour and I have alot of storys to share to people I know who aren't in the circus buissiness. I am sure that anyone who isn't in the circus would love it! But also find it very tough.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also suggest reaching for your dreams. What do you want to be? Go for it. If you think you have what it takes, you should definently try to be who you want to be. Don't let anyone change your mind!</p>	2		20131023164427	562	2		20131024113829	935	2

Then suddenly all the lights turn off and only one is on. Then a loud voice comes on and says h'm Good afternoon ladies and gents, girls and boys. Tonight we are going to perform the most dangerous acts , the mos amazing acts, and the most beautiful acts. So better take a seat and do not miss anything.'' The first thing we saw where beautiful white horses. They were so graceful and they did not mess up in anything. Then we say some leopards and tigers. We were all amazed because we thought they would going to attack the man that was controlling them but the didn't. Then these huge elephants came out and women were riding on top and they were wearing white feathers on their head. The elephants were so beautiful there was even a baby elephant. It was so cute. Then some acrobats came and they did a lot of cool tricks everybody was saying WOW. Everyone was really amazed and having a good time. We thought they were going to fall down because they were hanging from a swing well it wasn't much of a swing. It looked hard to seat on because it was only a pole. There would be 2 swings and one of the acrobats would jump would jump on one of the swings. Then he would jump on the other one. And he would stay there and wait then another acrobat would jump on a swing and get ready to grab the other acrobat because there was only 3 acrobats. The women grabbed on the other acrobat and they would just throw her back and fort. Then it was the really last act and it was clowns the did funny tricks everybody was laughing so hard. They were almost falling of there seats. And when it was over EVERYBODY clapped, clapped and whistled because we like there acts.</p>	2		20131023131652	693	2		20131023195433	562	2

She wished that one day she would be as good as Dougie, her favorite acrobat. Dougie looked as beautiful as a supermodel when she performed. She was as graceful as a swan. She had such elegance that you couldn't take your eyes off her. She was MESMERIZING!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked day after day practicing Dougie's every move, making sure every little movement was perfect.

She sometimes never went home at night. She wanted to be Dougie so much for so long that she just couldn't give up. She evenally she got so angry with it she went home and just cried in her father arms screming, &quot; I can't do it!!! I CAN'T DO IT!!! I'll never be like Dougie!!!!!&quot; Her father coforted her all night in she finally stoped crying.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he said, &quot; But your not Dougie your The Circus Girl!!!&quot; and then she reizied that he was right, she wasn't Dougie, she was THE CIRCUS GIRL!!!!!!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END!!!</p>	2		20131023130535	537	2		20131023193436	562	2

Then we went in our classroom and the teacher and a clown were talking then the teacher said &quot;Ok Mr.Hudd is going to pass out a flyer to only some of you&quot;. So then I got one and it said on the title &quot;Win front row tickets to a circus&quot; so i was looking through it and I decided to try and win them. So then school was over and I started to type out all the things I know about a circus. But I didnt get far because the power went out for 2 hours and I couldnt type so then I started to write but I went to the bathroom and my dog ate my paper! Then I couldnt do anything but wait untill the last minute. 5 Hours passed and the power was still out then one more thing happend I was so tired I fell asleep. I was seeing strange things in my dream like on thing was a clown was stealing a diamond necklace from the jewlery store! Then I woke up and didnt want to write about it yet. Later I did research about this exact carnival and it was in India! Now how am I going to get to India? B</p>	1		20131023132240	690	0		20131023140253	935	1		20131025102706	543	1

Today we were going to do the biggest show we had ever put on in my life time.&nbsp; I had never done this big of an act.&nbsp; Today we were going to go to america. I had never been to america in my life though my parents had been many times.&nbsp; I started getting dressed slowly in to my outfit for the show we had practiced many times for this show.&nbsp; we were performing in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp; It was not at all like home. There were no forests just palm trees every where to be seen. there were no big neighborhoods just streets and big glass buildings.&nbsp; The time change really got to me but I had been traveling in america for 6 months so i had gotten used to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got out of the car and went down to the pie car for some pasta with sauce.&nbsp; &quot; well you are up earily&quot; said my mother behind me.&nbsp; &quot;Hello mama&quot; i said. I could hear the tiredness in my voice.&nbsp; I saw my mother was tired to.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finished my pasta and went down to the big top to pracitice my act. I did my flips onto the trapize and shaped my self into God knows what.&nbsp; flipped myself off landed in the net bowed and jumped off.&nbsp; I had anthor act to but i needed my partner who was not awake or was still at the pie car so I practiced that again. When I finished I turned to the floor and saw my partner.&nbsp; &quot; Lovely&quot; he said finally.&nbsp; &quot;Gratzi&quot; I said. I looked into his eyes and he nodded he knew i was asking him to practice we did our routine. I started on the trapize and did flips and turns then i hung by my feet and waited 5 seconds then I flipped back up and saw his reaching for mine. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I went on through out the day.&nbsp; finally it was time for the show.&nbsp; My feet were tingling.&nbsp; I was nervous I was fine with doing the act ifront of&nbsp; italians but i had never done this in front of americans.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; when I heard my name I went out I heard them speaking english yes i was fluent enough to under stand them bu t they spoke it so clearly that i had never heard something like that. &nbsp;</p> <p>I went up on the trapizeand did my solo act in the stiff dress that would hardly let me move.&nbsp; twist turn twist turn i thought. then i jumped of did a flip in mid air and came down.&nbsp; there was silence from the croud. &nbsp; then they burst with clapping and shouts and hoots and hollers flowers were shooting tword me like bullets.&nbsp; I bowed and climbed up the trapize again once i was on the trapize every one was silent i could hear crickets&nbsp; then I began the act.&nbsp; 5,4,3,2,1 up i thought then i saw his hands and i was thrown into the air and then i landed on the ground with him behind me we bowed and went in they cheered louder than before and my eyes filled with tears i had done it I had made forien smiles.</p>	1		20131022100411	545	1		20131022112938	562	1

After all the rest of the jobs are done we get dressed and ready for tonight's show. After the show is over we all eat dinner then go to bed excited for tomorrow's show.</p>	2		20131022161159	935	2		20131023131555	693	2

They have to practice a lot for there show they need to practice so they do not fall down. If they fall then that's it they have to stop that part of the show then there's clothing the clothing is the easy to do because. All they do is just grab there outfit and just put it on.

Because you would want to mess up in front of a whole bunch of just sitting there watching you when you mess up.That is where the saying &quot;Practice makes perfect&quot;. comes from the circus. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Next,i am going to tell you about the salary. the salary is a big thing now with the economy failing. Working&nbsp; with the circus would not be the best choice. if your losing money.Right now because as you keep going you would make a little money. But not enough to survive in life. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now i am going to tell&nbsp; you a very important thing if you sign up for the circus you would only not make a lot of money.Sure you would make money to put food on your family's plates but not enough for new clothing or school supplies. But you would not get to see your family a lot. working in the circus switching your hours around like crazy. Either you be sleeping,&nbsp; practing, or being on tour. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an up side to working in the circus. you could make friends.get your name in the world. But that does not only mean waste your time. with your friends.when you work in the circus thing change your travel you notice different things you've never noticed in life like different community's that may be failing with life. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Those are things that would come up in your life.If you worked in the circus .it may be fun at the time but it is not worth it in the end especially if you get a good education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	0		20131021110819	693	0		20131021130558	556	0

The host announced now performing Ron Gooding.&nbsp; It was gonna be my first time juggling with knifes on fire.&nbsp; I got out there and the music started.&nbsp; I started juggling.&nbsp; I then walked on top of the tight rope and started walking on it and juggling the knifes.&nbsp; But then I fell.&nbsp; Luckily there was a net but the knife went in to my eye.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I got rushed to the hospital but it was to lated the docter had told me that i needed a glass eye.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023150658	541	2		20131023161808	556	1		20131025134856	552	1

I will be doing a trapeze act. The announcer is getting ready to say my name. &quot;Now, for our trapeze act!&quot; I step out and start to climb the ladder. At the top start to feel nervous.</p> <p>I feel like I'm going to fall. I grab my swing. My partner grabs theirs and we both jump. I did a flip and my partner grabbed me. The crowd is cheering when we get to the other side!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;After the show my parents come and congradulate me. After a long days work I go to the pie car for dinner.

They have to wake up at 7:00 and go eat breakfast then if your a kid you have to go to school from 9:00 to 3:00 Then you have to get ready for the show and eat dinner then you perform. The circus is very tiring because you have wake up early and you don't go to bed till around 12:00 but it is also a lot of fun because you get to travel the world and go to so many amazing places.You also get to meet so many people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; There are so many things about the circus that really cool but in order to do those cool things you have to work hard to join the circus. You have to be determined, you have to now you want to be in the circus. You also have to study hard to get into the circus but not like study in school, you have to study acting and do a bunch of performances when your a kid. You also have to be funny and not be scared in front of hundreds of people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; The circus is a great place to go get a laugh or hang out with your friends and watch a show, it is also is a place to see amazing tricks. If you ever go to a circus you will have a great time seeing all the animals like horses, monkeys, and lions. You will also have a great time, and see an amazing show.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131022120034	690	1		20131022205026	562	1

You see, I am a trapeze artist who is practicing for the big show tonight. I work hard for every show to make sure I do it just right. As I am back stage practicing my act, I can see all of the other circus performers practicing their act. Being in the circus is fun, but it's lots of hard work. You always need to practice, know what you're doing, and you have to have a certain talent. You can't just learn it! So, if you keep on reading you'll find out I what mean.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are practicing you have to know what your doing and how you are going to perform it. Are you going to&nbsp; have a partner? Or are you doing a solo act? These may soud like easy questions but when you're a circus performer these are very inportant questions. Then when you have it figured out you have to practice for hours a day. You have to keep going over and over and over your routine until you know it's perfect. Then when you are positive you're ready you wait until the everyone else ready then you put on the show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you know what it means to practice for the show, let's talk about the fun part. As soon as you step foot on stage you get this amazing feeling inside. It's definitely a rush! You see all of those cheerful faces in the fantastic audience and you know they're all watching you and know you'll put on a great show. You want to have a great show too. But in order to do that you have to remember every step of your act. You are for going to feel nervous but then the music starts and when you do the first move of your act it comes to naturally and are no longer nervous about doing it. In fact you feel like your just at home messing around with equipment. You hardly notice the crowd. but when you finish your act, you see all the smiles and you put a smile on your face, take a bow, and make room for the next performer.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you've heard about the hard work and the fun it's about time you know the schedule. At 8:00.a.m. you go the pie car. That's where all of us circus performers eat. At around 9:00 we head over to the circus arena. We all practice there until about 12:00. Soon after that we put on our costumes, get hair and make-up done, then practice some more until it's our turn to go up. Soon after we put on new costumes and give the crowd a grand finally. After the show is over we wait until&nbsp; the next show and are to do it all over again.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's what's it like to be a circus performer. It's lot's of hard work but it all pays off in the end. Lot's of people may think it's we just figure it out and have fun with it but it's not. Even professionals need training. So next time you go see a circus think about how hard they worked to make it perfect. Then ask yourself this question,&quot;Do I really want to become a circus performer?&quot;</p>	2		20131023165119	562	2		20131024102425	690	2		20131025134328	495	2

I had no where to go I kept calling for them, but they would never come. Then the unspeakable happened, Some one found me! He nursed me to a three year old baby, then he explained to me the way I was saved and told me his name(Voric Oglar). As I got older Voric noticed my muscles starting to grow. By the time I was eight I could lift a horse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Voric mentioned the circus, I knew what it was because my old parents used to work their. I said I would love to go to the circus, so we did. When we got their I saw tall people, short people, hairy people, and magic people. We got to the end of the line to sign up, and he said,&quot;State you talent and your name&quot;. I said my talent is strength, and my name is George Wringling. The man stopped and said,&quot;hold on just a little bit&quot; and left the booth and entered the circus tent.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man from the booth came back and said,&quot;George meet Mr. and Mrs. Wringling.</p> <p>Then everything went silent so quiet you could hear a pin drop a pin in confusion, and hatered all circling around that one day they left me. Then it went back to normal. &quot;We're sorry&quot;, the Wringling's said. &quot;Their's nothing to be sorry about. You left me that day I don't know why but you did, and you can't be forgiven,&quot; I said.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We can explain&quot;, they said. It all started the day at that farmers market. We put you in your baby stroller. Before we left, you fell out, but we didn't know you did until we left and got back to our tent. We came back as soon as possible but then you were gone. &quot;I guess it's resolved then,&quot; I said. &quot;Now we're a family,&quot; The Wringlings said? &quot;Now we're a family,&quot;I said!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023132129	935	2		20131023161807	556	1		20131025124758	543	2

He&nbsp; was a rather small child. Bullies mostly targeted him. He went to Hawthorne Elementary school In San Luis Obispo,CA. His school went up to kindergarten through 7th grade. Timmy was in the 5th grade he mostly got bullied by the 6th and 7th graders. The kids in his class always picked him last to be on there team in P.E. And most of the kids&nbsp; made fun of his last name. They called him Butt burn and worst names like buttsnifer. Timmy usually ignored these dreadful names and thought about his dream which is being a magician in a circus. So Timmy was walking home one night and he saw a poster that said LITTLE MAGICIANS NOW HIRING. Timmy was happy to see this poster, he already new a lot of magic tricks. He had a lot of magic kits and he watched videos on YouTube on how to do magic tricks all the time. So the next day Timmy's parents drove him to the performing arts center. There they signed a lot of papers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple hours after that Timmy's parents packed his bags and they left. &quot;Bye honey&quot; his mom said. &quot;Bye son his dad said.&nbsp; Timmy was starting&nbsp; To Feel a little homesick now that his parents were gone and he was with some of the administrators on a private jet. When the plane landed, the administrators guided him to a Funny looking trailor with a couple of other kids. When he walked in the administrator greeted Timmy to the kids he said, &quot;Hey kids this is our new magician&nbsp; ,Timmy bottomburn. Everyone lafted . Timmy was feeling sad about his weird name. He thought, &quot;why did my stupid parents name me this&quot;.In about a couple of minutes&nbsp; everyone stoped lafting. Then everyone told him that they were sorry for laffing. It turns that they have wierd names to. There were 2 girls and 2 boys. There names were Sally pukeeater, wendy Slimeball, Jhonn Bighead and Amari blood face.

It was a Circus banner being pasted on a brick wall by a youge boy, the poster had two elephants and a person on each one then a clown was trying to get on to one of the elephants. '' Circus To-Day'' I read aloud, Jane had an excited look on her face '' We should go.'' '' After all we just got done with school, we could go ask our parents on the way.''I looked at her, not saying a word because she was the onlt one in the whole shcool who knew that I wanted to be in the Circus. She said it would be a good job for me. So the time we got home our parents already put us on the list to go to the Circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ''We won't be able to go to the Cicus so you will have to take care of Jane while you are there'', ''okay Bill''. Bill was my great grandfathers name so I thought she got my name from him. Jane started to pout about going with me instead of going alone. Jane is 10 and I am 12 she says since she is almost as old as me she should go alone. Dad lay on the chair yet awaken be the sound of her pouting.'' You won't go anyhwere if you don't stpo pouting''. He said in a earitated voice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''Bill is&nbsp; your older brother and you should respect that''. Mom said. As we went to go to the Cicus we were very queit untill we were on a bathroom brake.When we got back in to the car we were tired so we took a nap, by the time we got there we were so excited that we could hardly wait to go inside. While we were inside I bought us some pop and popcorn for the show. When we were there Jane was talking the whole show but then it was the grande fanally with the loin tammer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '' That is the best part'' I said,when we got home I knew what my dream was it was to become a performer in the Cicus and when i got older I had&nbsp; to do it and I did I had lived my dream and it was amazing.

You probally think that their jod isn't hard at all and that you can do all the tricks they can. Well these people risk there lives everyday doing dangerous stunts tricks and more to entertain the crowd. They have to work every minute of the day and they have have to be determined.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of being part of the circus is that you have to work hard at your trick and you have to be good at your talent you have to practice on your craft every single day because you can't go out there and be sloppy. As part of the Circus you also have to do chores like groom the horses, give them water, and also have to give them alot of care.</p> <p>&nbsp; You have to balance out the time of your act with the ending of your act and you also have to own your act you must practice, practice, practice till your act is perfect. You must pay attention to what you do and more. You also have to make sacrafices like giving up your family time and more. You have to work alot of long hours and weekends as well.</p>	2		20131023164914	562	2		20131024102425	690	1		20131025131342	543	2

My life in the circus was so fun I love being in the circus. What you do in the circus is you have to be in very good shape. You always have to be healthy.One time in practice i fell off the balence ball. After that we strech out our legs and we try to do circus acrobats. Sometimes we will try tightroping. That is the funest out of all tightroping I love tightroping. All of the circus clows are SCAREY!!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	1		20131023161808	556	1		20131023220330	537	1

I am the traner for an elephant named Bungo. One day there was a terible accident that happend. This accedint involved Bungo and a very rude citizen. It was my first day on the job and I was out practicing when I was hit straight in the face.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It was a peanut! a peanut, then I heard some laughing in the stands. I looked up and saw a dad and a kid sitting there and laughing at me. The next thing I know the security comes and takes them away. I think to my self how rude that was.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; then I hear some yelling coming from the security. next thing I know the dad and kid are in the same spot doing the same thing. Throwing peanuts at me and laughing. then I yelled and said security get these people out of here. The next thing I know I hear what sonds like a gun shot. Boom!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kid has just been shot! what the heck is going on shouts another person whating for the show to start. Then Bungo starts getting scared. It is not good when Bungo gets scared because as you may know elephants are 20 times bigger than humans, and can do a lot of damage to a helpless citezen. then some of the other elephants start to get scared. the next thing I know Bungo is charging full speed at the stands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the worst thing possible happens the rest of the crowd starts going bonkers. They are screaming, yelling, and shouting at each other to move out of the way. Then I hear it. CRASH!! The whole group of people over by the stands where the dad and kid were start screaming and crying in pain. The police come and they are forced to tranculize the elephant so that no one else gets heart.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that my freinds is my story.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The End</p>	1		20131022120150	556	1		20131022161303	541	1		20131024095142	552	1

Theres nothing better and bigger than going to this circus. My favorite thing in the circus is the tite rope walkers. It takes a lot of balece and incuregement to do that. Some people do titeropeing over the grand caynon.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My second favorite thing thats fun is taming the animals. It would be fun because you get to see exotic animals. Like monkeys,horses,lions,and much more. It would be scary because it's a wild animal. Oh yeah don't they train elefents too? I think they ride the elefents and make them do tricks.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third thing is acrobatics. It would be fun, swining from ropes. They do cool things in the air. Like do a flip in the air then the other guy catches him. The thin of gravity is a strange thing. just to be that high would scare the crabs out of me.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the circus is a fun thing for me. I'v never seen a circus but It'll probely be fun anyway. I'd like to se all this stuff.Titerope walkers,animal tamers,and acrobats.all really cool things. And it would be a cool to be under a big top.

Right now myself and the rest of the crews and performers are pulling into our next location for our show!</p> <p>When, we come to a stop the animals are unloaded right away by the trainers and the muscle men. Next, the tent is unloaded along with the stilts for the stilt/juggleing act. Lastly, the performers get to start getting ready for the show that night.</p> <p>&nbsp; Now, that I can start my fun I get out my leatard and big box of makeup. First,I need to of course get on my outfit so later I won't mess up my makeup. Then, when I finish with my outfit I first need to put on my powder pink blush and my aqua mascera. Next, I put on the purple eyeliner, navy eyeshadow, and best of all my favroite light pink lipstick.</p> <p>&nbsp; Once, I'm done I head to the pie car for a light dinner. So, once I reach the car everybody is already there talking and eating dinner. Then, when I get my food and start chowing down the food everybody is gone.</p> <p>&nbsp; When, I finish and leave the cart the circus is about to begin so I rush to the tent and open the flaps just when they call my name to introduce me to the crowd. So, in I went to meet the anxious crowd!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131022161227	690	2		20131023130432	556	1		20131025100511	543	2

I'm so exited I can't wait any longer to get up on my plank and do my tricks and flips.This is amazing! My dad is going to be so proud of me. Well for now I'm going to eat dinner but not too much I still have a show. Tonight is going to be the most amazing night of my life. I'm going to first do a front flip off of a horse and land on a tiger. The tiger will then try many times to bite my legs off, but I will fight it. Once the tiger is unconscious I will jump off of its chunky body onto an innocent bear. The bear will not do anything but I will force myself to knock it out too. That is my reunite. I make my way onto the podium in the center of the tent. People are screaming my name &quot;Fail Fail Fail Fail&quot; the beautiful words ring out in my ears. I jump from my horse mounting the Lion which acctualy almost bites my legs off, but I manage to knock it unconcious, I jump to the bear which does stand still and I repeatedly punch it until it is just a sleeping body on the floor. It was over, for me too the tiger bit my legs off....................................</p>	1		20131023163857	541	1		20131024102425	690	1		20131025144758	543	1

Three years later he was a well known performer because of his awesome act. He would be shot out of a cannon at over 100 miles an hour! His act was very dangerous but he wasn't worried.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day they were putting on a show in his home town. Bob was nervous that his parents would see him and make him quit the circus. Then his parents saw a flyer at the store and Bob was on the front his parents were mad. They bought a ticket right away they were going to bring their son home. They saw him do his dangerous act and after the show the went to the performers tent and had a talk.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they were about to take him home when...

I schedule my day out. I go to school at 9:00 A.M. School ends at 3:00 P.M. From 3:00 to 3:30 I have a break.At 3:30 I do chores and practice. One of the things I am trying to master is leaping from a trampoline onto a horse's back.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, at 6:30 P.M. it's dinnertime.Our family does 10 shows a week. The show ends at 10:30. I get to bed at midnight. I am exhausted from the hard days work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to join the circus you need to have a specific talent, the right body type, and be very determined. You have to concentrate on dancing and performing. One good thing about being in the circus is that you get to travel around the world. One bad thing about it is that you miss your family.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131024102315	693	2		20131024113856	545	2		20131025150914	539	2

She was very flexible and nice she also had a kind of spark to her face that made her look both pretty and mysterious at the same time. She has always wanted to visit the circus but her parents never let her because they didnt want her to be influenced and grow up to be a circus clown. They wanted her to have a nice and educated life so she could grow up to be a doctor.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day on her way home from school she saw a flyer taped to a post lamp. She couldn't believe her&nbsp; eyes . It was a flyer that said there was a circus coming to the town of Buckross. That was the town she lived in . Right away ideas started flowing to her mind and she began thinking of ways she could go to the circus without her parents knowing . She ripped the flyer off the lamp and read the words printed in a small font at the bottom: Saturday October 18. Five dollars to get in she had 15 in savings.Later that day she went up to her room and started writing down the possibilities. That's it! She finally figured it out after after almost an hour. She looked at the flyer one more time it starts at 2:30. She would tell her parents that she had to go to study at that time until 7:30.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday morning finally came she told her parents at 1:45 until&nbsp; that she was going to meet her friend at the library for a study session. They agreed and asked if she needed a ride. She reasoned with them until they agreed to let her ride her bike there. She almost forgot her back pack because if she went without it her parents would become suspicous&nbsp; so she emptied out her back pack and got out her water bottle and some snacks. When she got there,there was a big man at the trailer door . She gave him 5 dollars and he let her in. She saw amazing stunts , acrobats, silly clowns, crazy jugglers, and even circus horses . The time got away from her as she watched with all her interest.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she looked at her watch it was 6:45. Oh no! She told her parents that she would be home at 6:15 . She rushed home and and when she walked in her parents were sitting in the guest room waiting for her. They were very upset that she was late. They sent her to her room in anger. When she got to her room the guilt was eating at her gut. She went&nbsp; downstairs and spilled her guts to her parents . She apologized as they stared at her in dissapointment and surprise. She felt terrible but better that she had told them everything. They gave her the same old speach and sent her up . She felt bad . But when she went to bed that night she dreamed that she was one of those acrobats swinging by ropes feeling as if she was flying happily.</p>	2		20131022165130	562	2		20131023090511	539	2

I travel alot and I am never home to see my other family. I work long days and I cant take a break or I won't be ready to perform.

I get up each morning throw on some sweat and a t-shirt and head down to the pie car where we all eat. I sit at the table with all of my friends and watch the crew all set up for tonights performance. Me and my friends all talk about tonights performance. We get two hours to eat then we have to go to the schoolhouse. It's like any other school, we have computers, tests, and report cards. All through class I was thinking about tonights performance. We are in Austrailia tonight and it has been my dream to perform here ever since I joined the circus. As soon as I knew it class was over and we all left the schoolhouse. This is the time where me and mt friends have a fun time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam, Emily, and me all run out and go play with the performers before we have to practice. We play with the juggling balls, the unicycle, which I am terrible at, and we play with the elephants. We all run over to the horses and feed them. I am in all the horse acts with Emily. Sam gets to go on the high blance beam. We all say goodbye and go practice. We all had to get ready for the big performance tonight.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and Emily are on the trampolines practicing our flips when the horses come over. We jump fromm the trampoline onto the horses back, we have to be concentrated and worry about our balance. We all tired after that! Me and Emily walk over to Sam where she is practicing her acrobatics. She is the best at them. We all decided that we should eat dinner together and get pumped up for the big show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all had to rush back to our trailors after dinner and get ready. The show was getting ready to start, this is my dream coming true. I knew my family was out in the crowd supporting me. The time came is was out performing. The best part is I get to perform with my best friend. I just feel like I am in a different world. That was the best feeling ever.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tonights show was the best! I am wiped out though. I walked back to my trailor slowly. I took off my costumes and got on my pjs. I sat there thinking about the performance and how it was the best! I sat there thinking about my family until sleep came over me.</p>	2		20131022211118	537	2		20131023130958	545	2

He said that he needed for someone to take over while he was in the hospital.Then,his best friend Cody told him he would take over and then Cody sprung into action.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cody was really worried. He didn't know a thing or two about circus acts or tightrope walking! Sarah,really perfect circus performer,taught him the basics.First,she taught him how to juggle bowling pins and other objects.He kept failling and failling and failling but then pretty soon he got the hang of it. Second, she taught him how to tame a lion and it was a piece of cake for him.Finally,she taught him how to balnce how to do tightrope walking and he was really worried on this part. After 3 tries, he finally manage to do it and then the circus was a sucsess and Micheal recovered from is injury an told Cody he did a great job and thanked him for filling in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Just like sports you have to pratice over and over and do the same thing in the circus. You start off with eating breakfest while your crew sets up things such as lights, and music for the upcoming show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing up eating breakfest you will go to school, like any other school you have test, computers, and report cards. Many of your classmates may speak different languages you haven't heard because people come from all over the world. Your classmates may speak languages such as Italian, German, French, and spanish.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When school is over you get a quick break many people may start doing differnt things like juggle balls. Clowns might even ride their unicycles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once it's almost time to start people practice or do chores. The trainer will feed, water, and groom all the animals for the act. While the trainer does that everyone else will be practicing what they will do at the act.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a few hours away from the act people go to the pie car to eat dinner, since they are going to preforming that night most of them don't eat much. Some circuses will do usually 10 shows in one single week.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally when the show is over everyone is tired and start to walk toward their trailer to go to sleep as they pass by they see the circus offices, concession stands, and stables.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this must sound fun they must continue on their tour without their family with them to support them and talk to them.

Next, I will go to the circus and get things ready so the circus crew can practice all their routines for the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; 10:00 am I will go to school. The school I go to is not a regular school. This school that travels with us for everyone who needs to be at school and is in the circus. Many of my classmates speak a lot of different languages like: Italian, Russian, and Spanish like my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:30 pm School is over. Then, I will start heading to the circus and start practicing my juggling and acrobats. I really like my routines. They are so fun. But sometimes they are scary because I feel like I am going to fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:00 pm I will come home and eat dinner. I eat dinner with my family. Sometimes my family and I eat food like: hamburgers, tacos, and chicken. But we do not eat so much because we are performing. If we eat a lot on the night we are performing we might have an accident during the show. We do 5 shows a week: one Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:30 pm The show is over. I`m really tired. My family and I are going home. Two days from now we will have another show. Now I am home. I`m in bed thinking about my next show. I can`t wait until my next show. I really like my shows. They are really fun because I like to practice my juggling and acrobats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00 pm I`m trying to go to sleep. But still thinking about when the tour is over. When our tour is over we will go back to our regular home in Hemet CA. When I grow up, will I still be a circus performer? Who knows?

It's a great feeling it feels so exciting it's a great experience. But you have to do allot like wake up early eat breakfast get ready, go to school, practice for the show, and finally what I love the most perform in front of that crowd. It makes me happy making the audience laugh and shout. And we can put up signs to tell people that we're coming in town. At night we somersault off horses, we tightrope walk, we juggle, we do acrobatics, and we make people laugh from our clown. thats why i love being in the circus.</p>	1		20131022165050	562	2		20131023130534	537	1		20131025100228	552	1

He had talent and confidence, and knew he could do it some day. George could do flips and jumps like never before. He was simply a dare-devil. He was a very brave boy with very good reflexes. He saw a flier that read, &quot; <b>We are looking for people with great talent that is confident and brave enough to be shot out of a canon! Join the circus today!</b>&quot; George kept the flier for years and years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later, George was eighteen years old. He was at his beautiful, new house, unpacking the last box. When he unpacked that box, he saw the same flier that he had kept since he was 11. He had just remembered that he wanted to be a circus preformer. He went to the new contest to join, and showed his skills and bravery!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later, he got a note reading, &quot;<b>Congrats! You won the contest to join the circus! Come to the same place as you did last time for the show tomorrow night. See you there!</b>&quot; George was very happy to hear this news, since it has been his dream for years! He finally got to his goal in life! George always knew that he had what it takes!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night of the circus, George had to sign a contract in order to preform. When he went into the stadium, he was a little nervous. He was mostly amazed of all of the obsticals and animals. He warmed up and went into the stadium on a tight rope! When he got down from the rope, he got launched out of a canon, and hung his feet on the bars connected to the ceiling. George landed on an elephant, and rode it out of the stadium.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the show, George was wiped out! He went into a trailor to sleep in while he is changing into pajamas and sleeping there. George knew that the show was great, and it amazed the crowd of people! He had a dream about what will happen in the next show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, George felt great. He went to the pie car for eggs and bacon. He also had orange juice to drink, because he didn't want to drink soda for breakfast. George was exited to go to the next show in Louisiana! It was far, but worth the long wait. He was just so exited about it though.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, he arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana. Another clown told George that they would be in a parade for Mardi Gras! He knew that Mardi Gras was a big holiday in the whole state! Alot of people were there for the parade to start. George was throwing necklaces and dabloons into the crowds from a float. After that, he started doing backflips in the very top of it! The parade was over, and George was even more tired than the last show. He did the same thing as he did at the end of the last show, and in the morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After George ate breakfast, he was ready to go back home for a while. When he got home, he was happy to have a job as a circus preformer, and loved it! He was wore out after every show, but he didn't care. The only thing he really cared about is accomplishing his dreams.</p>	2		20131023130958	545	2		20131023203721	543	2

Also many of my classmates speak a forien language.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When school is over insted of going straight to homework, and chores like a normal girl would do I actually get a short break. During my break I juggle, and ride unicycles.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, after that I have to do my chores. Some of my chores are things like taking care of the circus animals, and&nbsp; helping get ready for our next show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I am finished with my chores it is dinnner time. We must eat lightly or we will be to full to perform. Once we are finished we head down to tonights show.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am exited tok watch the show, and know that someday I will be a part of that. But I am also exited to come home and get some sleep. Living life in the circus is both complecated and exiting. I hope that some day you will live your dream just like I am mine.</p>	2		20131021111958	562	2		20131021140942	537	1		20131022111032	552	2

When I came into the world it was in the middle of the Circus. My mother who was pregnant had such cruel care givers that they didn't notice that she was pregnant until in the middle of a show she gave birth to me. Some little 11 year old girl ran from the stands and helped my mother with everything. Now that little girl is my owner and she is not so little anymore. She is now 22 and her name is Brooklyn. Brooklyn and I are the stars of the show in the Barnum and Bailey Circus. Our signature move is when Brooklyn is standing on my back while I'm loping and I jump a 5 ft fire lit pole and we make it every time because we trust eachother so much. When she is on me she becomes part of me. It is just so magnificent. Well anyway today we were doing our signature trick and the pole was not balanced right so the pole fell right of when I jumped over. Before we knew it the whole tent was on fire. Brooklyn ran me outside and when everyone else ran all over the place&nbsp; Brooklyn called the Fire Depatment. Then she ran back into the tent and sprinted back out with as many animals or animal halters with an animal atached to the end as she could. She raced in and out until everyone and every animal was out of the burning tent. She went in to take one last look around and thats when a beam that held the tent up fell directly on her. She was screaming for help. I raced in there as fast as I could and pushed and pushed until the beam was off Brooklyn. Then I helped hr onto my back and carried her all the way to the hospital. She turned out all right but if I had not gotten the beam off of her that fast she would of died. When we got back to the Circus the fire was put out and I was known as the horse her saved her owners life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The End</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023130958	545	2		20131023140900	539	2		20131025112209	543	2

You have to eat right and stay in shape. It is hard to be in the circus as hard work as they work if you had to do the thing they do. They have to walk on ropes, breathe fire, and a lot of hard thing that you would not even thing of doing I hope. THere is a lot of bad thing about the circus too. You have to have long trips, wake up early, and a lot to do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why I think it is hard to stay in shape is because if you dont eat alot you will be hungry if you eat alot then you will be full before a shoe. What do you do in that case. Staying in shape is hard but not that hard. You just need to work out and go to that gym. But that is two reasons why being in the circus is har and not fun to be in.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My other reason why it is fun to be in the circus is because you get to walk on some ropes. It might be dangerous but it might be fun. Most trapeze preformers have a net below the rope if they fall. Some trapeze preformers think that they are so good that they dont need a net but if they fall they are not good anymore.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Other reason why it is fun to be in the circus is that you get to breathe out fire if you are the fire eater or something like that. I dont know how they do that but they get a big long stick with fire on it and puy it in there mouth. That is so cool and dangerous alot of poeple think that is cool why I don't know. That is my other reason why bering in the circus is fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; My othe reason why it is fun to be in the circus is because you get to do a lot of stuff that you don't see everyday. People practice a lot of how you stuff that is fun nd cool. You should thank people if you go to the circus because they but a lot of work in to it. Please it is not easy to but fire down you mouth, or walk on thin ropes and if you think it is than try.That was my last reason why the circus is fun and some reason why it is not fun.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to be in a circus but I have to be more.</p>	1		20131021145504	537	1		20131021152206	562	1		20131022133703	552	1

I work in the amazing circus called <b>THE EXTRAVAGANZA</b>. I started working there when I was only a little girl. People may think that working in a circus is fun, and that you get to play around all the time. But no, it's not like that. If you want to be in a circus, remember there is a whole lot of work ahead of you. But at the same time, it is not torture.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyday, I wake up at 7:00 A.M. I get ready, and go to the pie car for breakfast. Today is the big show, so the crew is getting everything ready. Then, at 9:00 A.M. it's school time. We have a tiny one-room schoolhouse that travels with us. We have all the advantages that a normal school would have such as, computer, tests, report cards, etc. My classmates are from all over the world, so we experience many different languages. As we travel around the country, our geography lessons come alive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:00, school is finally over. I get to play with my little dog, Brownie. We are not allowed to keep big dogs because of our miniature trailer. Later, at 3:30 P.M. I do my chores like, grooming, feeding the animals for tonight's show. My parents are practicing their solo act. My dad is going to somersault off a running horse, and my mom is going to walk a tightrope. I am going to train animals to do tricks. At 6:30, we eat our dinner. Finally, it is time for the show!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 10:45, and the show is over. I am exhausted. Then, at 12:00, I am ready to sleep. Every show night, I go to sleep thinking that two days from now I will have to do another show.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, my life is not only fun, but tough. My life is a circus!</p>	2		20131022164838	562	2		20131023103511	539	2		20131025095714	543	2

I am Emma, the tightrope walker. As a circus performer, we do many different jobs. For example, you may be wondering, why is a tightrope walker jumping through a hoop of fire? Well, that is why I am going to take you on a journey to see what a circus performer does and how I got interested in being one.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in a circus, you have to be and early bird because we sleep at&nbsp; 12:00 and we have to wake up at 7:00. In a typical day, I go to the pie car, go to school, have some free time, have dinner, and have a circus performance. After all my shows I am wiped out! As a tightrope walker, it takes a lot of balance and concentration, so I have to practice five hours everyday!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me tell you how I got interested in being a&nbsp; tightrope walker. When I was young, I had a habit of balancing myself and walking on the terrace. My whole family performed in circuses, but I was too young to start performing. But, when the day came, I showed the crowd what my talent was, walking on a tightrope. Later, it was said, I was going to be the tightrope walker for all my shows.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, as I got older, my dad told me that I was old enough to do different stunts, not only the tightrope walk. You may be wondering, is'nt it hard doing different performances at once? Yes, it is very hard, but being in the circus meant a lot of training and I wanted to win my dream and be a circus performer. There are many ups and downs of being a circus performer, but I don't want to let down my family and quit the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is my last show and I want to show the world who I really am. Today, I am walking on the tightrope, getting shot out of a canon, and jumping through a hoop of fire. As I walk on the tightrope step by step, I see the crowd staring at me in astoshment as I jumping off the tightrope and land perfectly in the canon. I get shot and make an amazing flip through the hoop of fire. I was the star of the show. As you can see, being a circus performer means a lot of hard work in order to accomplish your goals.</p>	2		20131022164645	693	2		20131023132240	690	2		20131025100322	539	2

The pie car doesn't have the best food, but it is the best you will get around here. I then heard a scream when I was in the middle of biting my bacon. I ran to the tent to see our show host looking at the broken leopard cage. I then saw a shade of blue on the lock. All of the circus performers then walked out of the tent to find the leopard. I then met up with my close friend Puly, which is his obvious nickname. He is always bugging me about not having a pet and always about his nails. This might seem odd, but his favorite hobby is painting his nails blue. He paints a different shade every day. Other than that, he is a pretty cool person.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were both looking for the leopard together, but he wasn't that worried or paying much attention. But whenever i got near his trailer, he would wonder off another way as if he didn't want me near his trailer. I probably figured it was because that was where he kept his nail polish stashed. And since he is always braging about it, he might think that I am jealous and I want some. That's when I relized were the leopard went. God, icould notice that shade of blue any where by now. I felt dumb not knowing that it was him.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then aproached Puly and dragged him to his trailer and kicked the door open. The leopard was found.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131023164428	562	2		20131024111828	537	2

He had no money and didn't have any parents. One day while he was begging for money and food, he saw a poster. The poster said that the circus needed one more person to start performing. The boy was excited about the offer, but he was also worried. He always wanted to be a juggler, but he couldn't juggle.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he decided to go to the circus and see how the professionals juggled. He took two bottles from the dumpster and decided to juggle the way the professional did. It was very hard and he couldn't keep the bottles in the air for ten seconds. He tried again and again, but couldn't seem to improve. He wanted to quit, but he would rather keep trying than go back to the dumpster. He practiced in the circus for weeks and weeks. Finally he got the hang of two bottles and then started adding more. After a month of practicing, he decided to juggle in the circus. He went to the circus owner and showed him how he could juggle. He was very tensed and couldn't keep the bottles in the air.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he decided to leave when the owner said that he could be a clown. That seemed to be a good idea at that time. He messed up a lot, but that was what made that funny. He was hired to be a clown and, if he could improve juggling, he could be a juggler too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the day to perform everybody was waiting for my tricks, and it was very funny.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, you can still see him in the circus. He is a famous juggler and a clown. He sometimes says that life in the circus is hard, but he likes it a lot better than the dumpster.</p>	2		20131024113830	935	2		20131024135502	693	2

You see, I work at a circus and we constantly travel. So, we live in these. A thought was nagging me at the back of my mind. I knew it was important, but I just couldn't place it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, my mom, in her acrobat's suit jumped into my room. &quot;Get up, you need to have a good breakfast, so you will energy to parctice for tonight!&quot; Tonight, I thought. What was tonight? But, I sat up groggily and changed out of my pajamas.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the pie car and grabbed a bagel. I ate it slowly, still not fully awake. After that I went to school. Today, I had a test. Was that what I forgot? No, my mom said <b>tonight.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3:30 I went to take care of and train the animals. I saw my friend Annie waiting or me. We both trained the animals but I had to do the acts on stage. &quot;I suppose you know what to do for tonight,&quot; she said. There it was again. <b>Tonight.&nbsp; </b>What was so important that happened tonight? &quot;Uh, I guess so,&quot; I replied. I started handing out meat for the tigers. They ate happily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dinner everyone was a little nervous.They didn't eat much. But I took a baked potato and slice of pizza with fries on the side. I sat down at the table my mom was sitting at. &quot;Why are you eating so much?&quot; she asked. &quot;Is there something wrong with that?&quot; I wondered. &quot;Yes, tonight is the biggest show of the year.&quot; she hissed. I gasped. How could I forget that? I only ate my slice of pizza and ran off to practice even more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I knew it, show time came. I ran on to the stage for my part and did my acts: jumping from a diving board, twirling in the air, and landing on a circus elephant. I did it. The crowd roared in approval. After that everyone clapped me on the back saying I did great. I was a little uncomfortable with all the attentinon, but I was still glad. The day had ended on a happy note.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021134146	562	2		20131021153718	690	2		20131022153054	552	2

I haven't been home in a long time, and I really miss my family. But sometimes, when I am performing, I know my family is watching me on T.V. But on the bright side, I have made many good friends in the circus. My life is busy, busy, busy. We visit a lot of cities every week to perform. The act I am now learning is very dangerous. I am practicing how to juggle knives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I have always wanted to be on a basketball team, but we don't have time. We do have school though, our classroom is full of people who speaks languages that I don't understand because, they are different people from around the world. It is really fun to travel as we can really see what the teacher was talking about in the geography lesson.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Becoming a circus performer takes a lot of practice and skill. Everybody has always asked me, &quot;What did you always want to do in a circus?&quot; I would always reply, &quot;A circus acrobat.&quot;</p>	2		20131022205427	545	2		20131023133153	562	2		20131025094104	543	2

My name is Emily Johnson , and my family is at the circus. It will be in our town for the next three days. When my brother, David, and I found out that we were going to the circus, we were both ecstatic. In fact, I want to be a circus performer when I grow up. We got into the car and drove until we reached the circus. Once we are inside, we sit down in our seats and wait for the performance to start. It is noisy , and everyone is anxious to see the trapeze artists, the acrobats, and all of the animals.</p> <p>At last, the performance begins, and everyone is suddenly</p> <p>silent. The music starts and we see the animals start to file out. There are elephants, horses, monkeys, and many more. They are all doing tricks with their trainers. We all watch in awe as the trapeze artists and tightrope walkers start their peformance. Next come the acrobats. It must take balance, hard work, and concentration to be a circus performer. Before I know it, the performance is over.</p> <p>We are led to the back where we are informed that we have the</p> <p>lucky seat numbers and that we are allowed to meet the circus performers. Because I am interested the most by the tightrope walkers, I ask to meet them. When I ask them how they decided to become a circus performer, one replies. &quot;I knew that I wanted to be a performer at a young age. You just have to go for it and give everything else up.&quot; she says. &quot;Is it fun to travel around a lot?&quot; I ask. &quot;Yes, because we get to travel the world, go to so many places, and meet different people that all enjoy watching us perform. However, we sometimes miss our family and our home. When we are performing we have to move constantly. We also work from sunup to sundown.&quot; another circus performer says.</p> <p>Before, I wanted to be a circus performer when I grew up. Now,</p> <p>I know that circus life is fun but also has its downsides. They experience the joy of performing in front of a live audience, and get to travel to many places, performing tricks. However, they have to travel often, work from sunup to sundown, and give up everything else. For now, I'll just settle for watching the circus performance instead.</p>	2		20131024113951	556	2		20131024144656	541	2

I wake up at 7:00 AM sharp and eat breakfast in the pie car, it is a trailer where we eat. While then the crew gets the tent ready. It is huge. Now it is 9:00, time for school. My school is a small room where there are computers, desks, and a teacher that travels with us. There are children who speak Russian, Italian, and French. Now I look outside and I see the geograhy lesson in real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is 3:00 school is out for today. I go and groom a horse. My father calls to me he says,&quot; I finally figured out how to do a handstand on a ball while holding rings with my feet.&quot; I say great and go and practice my trick. It is doing a juggling act on a tightrope. I fall but luckly there is a net under me. My mother is practicing tricks with a lepord. Them suddenly I hear someone saying,&quot; Callia. Can you help me here.&quot; Right a way I knew that was my mother. I raced to her. I thought she was in danger because of the lepord but to my suprise the lepord sat down and wouldn't get up. I helped my mom and went back to my practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is time for the show I was nervous but my mom said,&quot;I&nbsp; don't think there is anything to worry about Callia. You did great in your practice and you will do great in this show too.&quot; So I did do great in my show and my mom and dad had no trouble at all.</p>	1		20131022120015	935	1		20131022144146	537	1

I know that many people think circus actors live a fun and easy life, but that is not true. There are both upsides and downsides to living in a circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a circus performer, I get a chance to travel around the world and visit many places. But I work from sunup to sundown and spend a lot of time away from home. If you decide to work in a circus, you need to have a specific talent, the right body type and be very determined. Not everyone can become and acrobat or a trapeze artist.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to wake up early and live in a train most of the time. You might need to learn to understand many different languages because circus performers come from all around the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a circus actor, you need to have patience, balance, and concentration. The stunts might seem a bit dangerous. You might be bitten by a lion or a tiger. You might crack your skull somersaulting off a running horse of leaping from a trampoline onto a running horse.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a circus, you have to perform every day and usually 10 times a week.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now you see what hard work it is to be in a circus. You might change your mind now about wanting to perform in a circus.</p>	2		20131022120126	562	2		20131022134427	545	1		20131024083828	543	2

My father is the ringmaster, my mother is the trapeze artist, my brother is a clown, and I am an acrobatist. I have been to every state in America at least once, and I have been to Japan, Turkey, Costa Rica, and Italy for a world tour.</p> <p>Most people think that being in a circus would be the best thing ever, but it isn't. I have to wake up a 6:30 every morning, eat a quick, light breakfast, go do a few hours of school, then go and practice my act until lunch at 11:45. After lunch, I do my chores and help anyone who needs help with something. Then I do an hour or two of more practice, and then it's time for the show. We do two shows each night (sometimes three) and always three on Saturday and Sunday too. Another bad thing about circus life is accidents. I lost concentration a few years ago on an act, and I fell and broke my leg, a rib, and my wrist. One year, my dad also lost three fingers when a lion got too excited. There have been other accidents too, but those we're the worst.</p>	2		20131023162731	562	2		20131023201708	541	2

I'm Angkitha. I'm an animal trainer at the Great American Adventure circus. We circus folks travel many places each day. We have a tight schedule for were we travel and what time we have to leave.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being in the circus is not easy. You will have to wake up at atleast 5:30 in the morning and work all the way until 9:00 in the night. In the morning you will have to wake up and eat your breakfast. Afternoon you will have to get ready for the show. After the show is done, you go to the trailer and get a good night's sleep and wake up in the morning at a new place.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people do not join the circus because they think it is a crazy place with no fun. Well, I can assure you that they are absolutely wrong. The circus is a very fun place for people and it is NOT crazy. You will experience the job of your lifetime! You won't regret it if you join!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have a circus job you will have to be talented and determined.</p> <p>If you want to be a tightrope walker you will have to maintain a good balance. To be animal trainer like me you will have to work well with animals and be willing to take care of them. To be an animal handler you will have to be neat and be willing to walk the animals back to their cages.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their is also a pie car, a place were the circus people eat. You can be a cook in the pie car. In the show, many people will come to see you, whatever job you have. Make sure to do your best and smile!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>	2		20131021134753	690	2		20131021154534	562	2

I am going to introduce you to my amazing yet tough circus life.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the morning at 7:00 A.M. I wake up and go eat breakfast. In the pie car, I eat bacon and pancakes everyday. You may think that is luxurious but it gets boring after a while. Then I go to school at 9:00 A.M. like every other kid. Just because I live in a circus, doesn't mean I can skip school. Class is in one big schoolhouse that travels with us wherever we go. Parents may be thinking that kids won't learn as much, but the truth is, we all learn the samethings even if the schoolhouse is portable. We also get tests and report cards like everyone else.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School ends at 3:00 P.M. Then, we get a quick break for about 30 minutes. Then, we have to practice for 3 hours. Some people would practice juggling and others would practice aerobatics. At 6:30 P.M. I would eat dinner. I don't want to eat too much because I might vomit while performing. When performing, you think about all the practice you have done and say to yourself,&quot;I cannot fail,&quot; as you do your amazing trick. Once the performance is done you feel proud as the audience gives you a standing ovation, amazed of what everyone thought about the circus.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 P.M. the circus is over. You feel very tired and you are ready to hit the hay. At midnight, you go to bed thinking about your family wishing you could meet them or even call them. &nbsp;</p>	2		20131024141536	935	2		20131024144920	545	2		20131024161547	539	2

Yes, trailer. I live in a circus, doing acrobatics and horse-stunts. I was probably destined to be a horse-stunter, as my dad is the ringmaster. As for acrobatics, I'm like a rubberband- elastic. I am so flexible that one could twist me into a pretzel. Hi, I'm Yvonne Lutz, your average 11-year-old circus performer. I always wake up this early, so I'm so used to it, I don't even stretch anymore. I get dressed, brush my teeth, and go to the pie cart for breakfast. The pie cart is like a dining hall, except it is a moving dining hall. As usual, on the menu is pancakes and bacon. I eat up quickly so that I have time to rest before school at 9:00.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is school time now.We only have one room, and like the pie cart, it is a moving school. My classmates all speak different languages from all over the world. I am French. We all get to learn about our lessons like history and geography hands-on, because as we move around, we get to experience many places with a wide range of historical and geographical views. Today we learn about Hopi Indians, as we are in Arizona, quite near to the Grand Canyon. We even get to see a medley of varieties of Hopi dances. Girls my age and even younger dance intricate foot patterns in noisy dresses. Noisy because they have shells that clang together, and as in loud, like gaudy. We go on a short one hour round-trip hike down into the canyon, learing about different plants we had never seen or heard of before, and their needs, adaptation, survival skills, and habitat, going deeper into it than 'desert' or 'canyon' or 'hot weather climate area.'</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now school is over at 3:00, and I can take a half hour break to let loose. This is when I write. I have a diary and a journal. I record the events that occur daily and school notes in my journal, why my diary holds my feelings, like my on-and-off hate for this hectic life. Sometimes I feel like I am going to explode.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 3:30 now. Break time is over. I have to do chores and practice. My favorite routines are the trapeze, tightrope walk, and anything to do with horses catches my fancy as long as I get to ride in the routine. And sometimes, the stunts don't involve riding. I practice crazy stunts on galloping horses, and many dangerous acrobatics like the tightrope. Sometimes I lose my balance and fall into the net that is not very far down. I only stunt when there is a safety feature involved. I never mess up in a show, luckily. That would be extremely embarassing. I pratice for three hours so that everything is perfect for the show. After I practice, I quickly try on my costumes before dinner. My acrobatics outfit is a neon sequined head-to-toe suit. It is cross-hatched metallic pink, bright yellow, electric blue, neon orange, and a neon or metallic version of almost every color of the rainbow. There is an argyle pattern of red-orange, yellow-green, blue-purple, and pink-purple. Clear and silver sequins dot the entire thing. It is like feety pajamas in style. But it is tight on the body, and flexible, too. The back of it also extends above the neck, grasping tightly to the shape of my body until halfway up my head, where it flares out. A Marti-Gras type mask, patterned the same as my suit is attached, perfectly fitting my face. My horse-stunting cosume is the same pattern, but with different colors, like a sparkly black, white, cream, tan, and peach, and for the argyle print a metallic mahogany, cadet blue, cerulian, and mauve. The style is breeches, with a silk button down shirt and a velvet coat with a pea-coat collar. The helmet, I wear none of. That is just more of the danger, and to add on, my boots, patterned just as my riding clothes, are high heeled. They are knee-high, and cut off in triangle shapes on the two sides, the cut-outs about four inches deep. I stare at them in awe, as they are lovely. I am a colorful person, and therefore love them both, but the acrobatics outfit to a higher extent.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 6:30. I have a light dinner, and then go to the Big Top to perform, as that is the tent for the major acts. I perform, always nervous yet excited, and think about how amazingly I did in practice, and my confidence soars. As I finish my routine for the millionth- and last- time this night, I wipe the sweat of my face and smile, taking a bow with the rest of the crew.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow! It was a long show as usual, but I'm always surprised by how long it is. It is now 10:30, and the show is over. I walk back to my trailer as slowly as a slug, as I am really tired. Once I get back, I brush my teeth and change.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is around 12:00. It is really late, and I pretty much collapse into my bed, falling asleep before the sheets even settle down.</p>	2		20131023161608	690	2		20131024102637	541	2
