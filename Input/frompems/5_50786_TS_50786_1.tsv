For example: the pedlar went to London because of a dream told him to, because he would find good news.  When he got there a shopkeeper told him to go home, because he should not have come just because of a dream and he made a point of telling the pedlar he had a dream that he would find treasure around an oak tree, but he didn't go.  That made the pedlar go home and dig around an oak tree and he found treasure.  That would teach the reader to follow your instinks and don't care what other people think about you.	2		20130812140833	1236	2		20130812140807	1223	2

The fictional part in this story is how he did what he was told and it came true like he was told. Also, some one who is poor usually doesn't listen to a dream ( shop keeper ) and magically find a boat load of tresure and gold coins in their back-yard.

Also, it is not a true story to be a mystery in history. Second of all, this story can`t be a fable because it would have some sort of life lesson at the end, usualy in a different type of writting. Finally, this story must have been told for a long time, which to me makes it a folktale.	0		20130812140831	1236	1		20130812140810	1264	0		20130820140834	1310	0

Why well it's not much of a mystery where you have to find clues & solve a problem, I don't believe this is a folktale either because folktales usally have a moral to the story & have odd things that can't happen like talking animals or they are about how something came to be in the world. A fable is a short story that is similar to a fairytale & usally something or someone gets fixed in the story.	1		20130812140854	1398	1		20130812140857	1276	1

Some reasons why because it tells of a pedlar with real life problems. That is why it is not a folktale. It doesn't tell of a mystery because there is no problem and it is to solve in a unknown kind of way. It is a fable because it tells of a peddlar's story, from rags to riches, and sounds like it could be a passed down story. Also the moral is found, that if you believe in dreams, anything can come true, and that makes it a fable.	2		20130813080804	1223	2		20130820150849	1661	2

Fables deliver important messages and this story doesn't.  This story is more likely to entertain people, not teach them an important life lesson.  This story only reminds us to help people.  Therefore, I think this is a folktale.	0		20130820160837	1180	0		20130820160849	1310	0
