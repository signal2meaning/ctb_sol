I know that from personal expereince. I also have concluded from personal account that students already know to be using a hushed voice because most students know how annouying it is when noisy children are about in the hallways. I think there should be no school rule, instead teachers should close there doors when teaching a lesson, give friendly reminders to noisy kids, and  understand that children are simply children. Kids my age can become excited and slightly raise there voice. Kids should take more caution in hallway jibber jabber as well.   In the New School Rule paragraph, it says the noise disturbs other students who are learning in their classes. I think that if children accindentally raise their voices every once in a while is acceptable.

I would go with the kids who say it is unfair for the following 3 reasons.  One of my reasons is that we are young teenagers.  Some might even be a teenager.  This means that we are about 42% adult so we should start preparing for that.  My second reason is that we might need to talk about our concerns in school.  Another reason is that we might day dream if we don't have excitement.  If we talk silently we have at least a little excitement without desturbing other kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        However if we can't talk quietly and disturb other kids then I think  It would be fair.  On one condition, from time to time, I think we should try and see if we can still talk.  If it gets better, then we could talk while in the hallways.

Our school will be filled with happiness... throughout the school.  That would be a good thing.  Therefore,  if it disturbs school time then they  should just talk quieter.  Sometimes, a teacher at our school comes out and yells at us for being to loud but there are some ways to prevent that from happening, such as shutting your door, putting signs to be quiet and having a teacher nicely remind them to lower their voices.  I think that if you gave the fifth graders a chance maybe, just maybe they could learn to be quiet in the hallways.      I don't think that fifth graders should have to stand in a line.  Maybe they can handle it.  If they must stand in a line then I think they should choose where they stand, or choose their own line order.  In 6th grade you don't stand in a line so it would be good practice if for middle school.  At the gifted program they just dismiss us and we don't have to stand in a line.  We get to talk about our class and be socially engaged with others more.

If a child is not in line they could push people and they could fall down and get hurt. I think that by walking in line, students will be much safer.               I think the rule about not talking in the hallways is very important. If children talk in the hallway, then they could disrupt classes. They could also disrupt children learning. If a child talks in the hallway, then they could promote other children to talk in the hallway. If there is too much talking in the hallway children will not learn as much. Talking in the hallway prevents students from reaching their full capabiluties.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2

Also, talking quietly doesn't make much of a difference because you might not if you are talking quietly or whispering loudly and other students will still hear you. This is what I think about the new talking rule.  Now, I will explain my thoughts about the line rule. Walking in line seems very awkward for fifth graders to do because I think the fifth graders are to old to be walking in a line. Sure, it will keep things organized and might even stop students from talking, but seeing five year old boys and girls doing it makes the fifth graders look dumb and sets a bad record on the fifth graders, making others think that the fifth graders aren't prepared for the great responsibilities of middle school and still need to be overlooked by teachers.
