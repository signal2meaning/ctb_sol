Police officers want bicyclists to be safe while riding their bikes out in the streets. Police officers want bicyclists to wear good, fit helmets so that if they fall the helmet wont fly off with the air and it wont move when the bicyclists are falling, hit their heads, and cause a damage to their brain. Out of 50 states, only 21 states have a law that requires bicyclists to use helmets while riding their bicycles out in the streets. It has been told that the bicyclists that use their helmets while riding their bikes have an 85 percent less of causing a serious damage to their heads. If bicyclist ride bikes out in the mountains there is a much more percent of causing damages to their body so police officers would encourage bicyclists to use more gear like helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, etc. During the day while the sun is shinning bright it is prefered that you wear bright clothes so that car drivers can see where you are and becareful while they are around you. During the bike ride it would be a good idea to carry water on your bike so that you dont dehygerate during the riding on the road below the hot sun. It is always good to ride with family members or friends but be sure if you are riding on a bike trail. there is enough space for bicyclists or other runner can go around you. If you ride at night it is safer if you have a flashlight with you or a light on your bike so bicyclists know where you are at and do not crash into you and cause an accident. If you have a cellphone it is never bad to carry. Put in your pocket or wherever you can put it in so that if you are riding with your group but somehow get seperated from them you have a way to contact for help. If there is no reason for having music playing in your ears do not have earbuds in your ears becuse loud music can cause you to get distracted and not pay attention on the road.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.83152290442513

Make sure you have water or other fluids with you, biking can take a lot of energy away from you and you don't want to get dehydrated.
